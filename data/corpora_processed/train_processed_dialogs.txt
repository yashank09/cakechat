Uh, I hear people say all the time, “Oh, I've learned so much, I learned this and I learned that and that was such a learning experience.” And I, all these years that I've been grown up, I haven't felt any learning, and I feel, “Well, what did you learn and how did you know that you learned it?” And it was a mystery to me. And just the last few weeks, or actually I've been realizing in the last year mainly is that I’ve learned some things and I know I've learned them and I, I know that, okay, that I'm at this point and with a certain situation or idea and that six months ago or three months ago it was different.And so I'm feeling my learning and that's really exciting.","condition" : "client"},{"text" : "And it’s the awareness of it that's new.
