[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Aye who am I? (Yeah)

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' dissed me, I'm suprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya'
See if I can paint for you the larger picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin's Black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be Black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your shows lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga
﻿
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And im all up in that spot
Hey

Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can't tame me!
My voice screech through the street.. I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn't for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn't trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don't kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Mate this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I'm so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I'm headed back home ain't staying that long
I'm chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I'm paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don't worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don't bother me at all though
Yeah say it don't bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

Hey don't cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don't cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey

﻿Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega-man on Sega man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah real black queen
If I had a genie,
I wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house
This shit was like a timeout from reality
One night you asked me what I'm crying about
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin
I don't know if he been drinkin
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling
And rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound
My mama saying get off me
My tears is tumbling now
I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12
I wish I would'be bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless
There goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast-forward to our older years
Two different paths
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way
Too proud to fold
Your demise
One day to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn
Not my nigga
The same one that told me that things always get better
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga
﻿[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes onlyI heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find

[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[C-Bo:]
I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit:]
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot:]
Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
to the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
get in my way, then that ass gots to go
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[(2Pac), E-40:]
(C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich)
Da Bay, beitch!

[E-40:]
Down the steps 
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him

[Richie Rich:]
(Check this out)
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[Ad-libs — 2Pac, C-BO & E-40:]
[2Pac:] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo:] The whole Clickalation fool
[E-40:] Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
[2Pac:] Why them niggas actin' like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at?
[D-Shot:] It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo:] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
[D-Shot:] It's a celebration
[E-40:] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[D-Shot:] Young 'Pac is back
[2Pac:] Ay D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up, please?
[D-Shot:] Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
[2Pac:] Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane
[E-40:] A motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy
[2Pac:] You supposed to
[RIch:] Sideways to the next light, and to the next coast, poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'
[2Pac:] Money over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B.

Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
If you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Matlock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the noise shit, rockin' jewels shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable
Keep bitches on they toes no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Bridge:]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Hook: x3]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Ain't that some shit bitch

Bitch
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce (bounce) [x4]

My nigga Syience killed this beat[2Pac:]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up
With this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you

[2Pac:]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas, ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa? And I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you, yeah, nigga, it's all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
(Yeah, nigga)
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch
From the West Coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, you knahmsayin'?
And then, you nahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same ho'
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah
Look at me now, I blew up in a jiffy
Yeah, no new niggas, always knew 'em if you with me
Made it out the land where they'll shoot you if it's envy
I'm a 90's baby but I grew up in the 60's
Nah I don't bang, ain't no rag to the left
I just walk around with some swag to my step
Pants sagged just a bit and a tab and a limp
Started cashing up checks, now hoes harassing the dick
Yo ma you drive me crazy so I need to take a test drive
Show you how to drive stick, let's ride
And you know it's comin' from the west side
So you know it's more guns and less lies
Can you believed that they told us for making when pigs fly
Nigga who you lying to?
I don't look that sick, but nigga that's why I'm flu
Let me remind you bitch, look at me now, cup full of brown
Sippin' on that Henny, niggas hating on me plenty
Upgrade from Explorer to that new car scent
I'm Hip Hop's savior, the new Clark Kent
The new menace in the streets
No lieutenants want the beef
But these niggas won't hold me back, no
These niggas gon' show me racks
Until then, bitch I won't relax, you

Look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got bitches, got my own home
Look at me now, now I got dough
Now I got dro and I'm in my zone
Look at me now, I'm signed to Cole
Got me label at 20 years old
Look at me now, I am the man
Now I got fans, so bitch that's a tat
Look at me now
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Look at me now
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Look at me now
Look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got style, now I got hoes
Yeah, look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got style, now I got hoes

I'm nowhere near done yet, dum-dum just check shit
I won't flex but I've been living for like 9 months off of one check
Lyrics and pussy come quick when my tongue flick
Pussy so dan wet, feel like you jump ship
I'm feelin' myself dawg, I'll give you that dumb shit
I'll give you that substance
I'll give you them straight bombs, I'll give you that Funk Flex
Flow's so cold, don't know what's gon' come next
My nigga I got this, it wasn't too complex
Watch from the curb and weigh up my options
School, drugs and having musical Complex
God spoke to my conscience, nigga went to church
Now I spit the gospel and get paid for when I speak
I could be selling drugs nigga, coulda ran a mook
But I decided to give you niggas this poetry
But if you not too chicken to flip birds, better duck

Look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got bitches, got my own home
Look at me now, now I got dough
Now I got dro and I'm in my zone
Look at me now, I'm signed to Cole
Got me label at 20 years old
Look at me now, I am the man
Now I got fans, so bitch that's a tat
Look at me now
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Look at me now
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Y'all ain't really fuckin' with a nigga
Look at me now
Look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got style, now I got hoes
Yeah, look at me now, now I got clothes
Now I got style, now I got hoes
Look at me now

All eyez on me
Yeah, all eyez on me
Eyez on me
I on' know
I on' know
Yeah, I on' knowI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, hoe!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers
To breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride
I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screaming as they drill me
But I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man
And pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

My murderous lyrics
Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops
'Cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble﻿
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like yah
Bad trips like "God!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright

[Hook - Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-hook:]
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

[Hook]

What you want, you a house you a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers


[Hook:]
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Could you be what you seem, Amazonian king

[Verse:]
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to yo queen
What a life we chose, nothing but hoes
The good ones you fuck between - getting hard to see em
Come on Arlene, could you be my vizene
I'm in need of your light, could you be my hot beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain't quite what I seem
In this city couple times a year, you know what I mean
Yea, you know what I mean
Bitch, you know what I mean
Girl, you know what I mean
I don't move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women livin on the sour, no
All the sweet ones end up chiefin on my dab of smoke
Only evening that's in question, we was laid up at the Wesson
Keep some candles that be scented until it does
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
For the loud, gotta dampen the sound yea
Got er deep in the sound, yeaPicture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[2Pac:]
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down
The shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage
They out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[2Pac:]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant for two of America's most wanted

[Hook]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[2Pac:]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Hook]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong

I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me

I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh ISince a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know that shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
You get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my commandLife can cause you much pain
There are...
Life can cause you
Life can...
There are...
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my storm
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count count, count it)
With my shine (Count, count, count, count it)
I'll give full stride

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' the paper it's sorta habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on them principles
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now the thought of them pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it

Big bills, big pills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas running tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck it it kills, it mix well
I'm only counting
Big bills, big pills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas running tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck it it kills, it mix well
I'm only counting...

Uno, dos, tres, quatro

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flipped mama's fortune and grown me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball in your court and
Escape with your bitch like we turning your heart in
She don't need no garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Uno dos tres

Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my storm
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pie﻿
Martin had a dream

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, I can feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

﻿"Yeah, nigga
I'mma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil--a lil ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga"

Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain't told ya na' lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can't find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma'am, I'm an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I'm armed and I'm Fayetnam's finest
Carolina's savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it's all said and done I'mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can't even get Waffle House
Hatin' niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil' tan
I'm ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I'm chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don't care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I'm throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I'm quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I'm only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain't know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out "The 'Ville, I gotta go there"
Boy don't you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain't fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain't there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain't there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it 'fore she even made the bed
Damn I'm no good, but damn it's so good
I'm picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I'm up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that's designer
I could give a fuck as long as there's something that's behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I'm the shit...oh yeah, I'm reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I'm ghost﻿[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last
I don't trust my own niggas now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy you know my L's dirty if they stop me I'm goin to jail surely
I'll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me
Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell Purdy (pretty)
And all I gotta do is call once and she'll be all ready
Yeah buddy can't you tell I'm goin thru hell
I don't even open my mail
I'm in the shower with soap on the towel
I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth but we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger then your whole team
You niggas so broke but yet somehow you seem so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money

[Hook:]
One time for the city, yea
Two times for you
Hey
And one time for the city, hey
Two times for you
Hey

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Look kid, it's raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns dumb bell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's a cease rest in peace
We tired of only having just a peace
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin' leavin' niggas stuck in bleedin' on the flo'
Bullets wet you like a semen on a hoe
Breathing slow man I inhale
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that's darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I've been real

[Hook:]
One time for the city, yea
Two times for you
Hey
And one time for the city, hey
Two times for you
Hey

[Verse 3:]
The more niggas sayin'
Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine
All he ever doin' is paintin' pictures of crime
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope
Bitch if you listen I'm paintin' pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin' the day he won't be the butt of somebody's jokes
See me; I lived it all from dirt-poorin' and trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein' the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets hey ma I'll be home soon
Was out chasin' ho's, was out hoopin'
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin'
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch

[Hook:]
One time for the city, yea
Two times for you
Hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you
Hey

[Outro:]
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon' know our name
Ain't seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin' 'bout you﻿Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don’t holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrolls
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rolls
Playing Jigga hits he say “good, make more of those”
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digornoes
They fucking with me because I’m real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I’m in this train with a mil to my name
Ain’t shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I’m built for the game
Something like a pimp because I’m still with the caine’
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can’t try
These niggas out here lying, why can’t I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can’t fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I’m flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it’s whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I’ve done been a nerd
Just choosing bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I’m just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got it coming now he might’ve been the first
So she only fuck with him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you’re black they won’t employ ya’
Well nigga I’mma show ya’, this that Jesse Jackson uh
Firmative; action so master I’m taxing uh
Don’t let the cover fool ya’, bitch I ain’t no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don’t gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a real nigga til’ the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know that I’m paid for this shit, nigga you God damn right﻿I see the, I see the..
I see the, I see the..
I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, Lord..
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord, Lord..

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

I see the rain pouring down﻿I see your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back

My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, dont tell her nothing bout me
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I'll be there, I'll still be there for you

In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you

Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I'll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky's
That they sent me, is that real love
You're the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

I'll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you

Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling , let me know whats on your mind
We've been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I'm never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey﻿[J. Cole:]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Hook x2:]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Bas:]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Omen:]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Hook x2]

[J. Cole:]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Hook x2][Intro:]
How did you know
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I'm tryin, will somebody make you just shut up about it?
Can we settle down, baby?
No, let's ride

[Verse:]
I'm wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain't no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I'm just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make, the decision's been made
I swear these bitches screamin YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feelin like a Porsche 4 door, used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still movin the yola, till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help, they never showed em
So we outchea, get it by any means
I'm on fire, no lion, them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep runnin, I'm supplyin the energy
Ain't a thing, you great a sin, I'm high on the canope
Lookin out for my niggas, keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch, I'm just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA, your favorite rapper's been amnestied
Don't pretend to be classy, ho
'Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test drivin broads, ho I'm a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Probly gon pinch, nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison's like the man, it shoulda gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it's waitin to be transplanted
Band wagon feelin, guess I'm grant standin
Got them hoes on all 4's, guess they can't stand it
Shouts to oak shades, shouts to bandana

[Hook:]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do, no
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, two bottles won't do, no

[Bridge:]
I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up, say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony 'cause they only want a piece
I'll be it, I see through, I never deceive you
Fiend

And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue

﻿[Intro]
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly

[Verse 1]
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

[Hook]
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy...

[Verse 2]
I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton
﻿Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up﻿Laaa la la laaaa
La la laaaa

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Hey, this is a song for my haters,
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Hey, this is a song for my haters,
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Haa, bitch I'm about to blow up
Uh huh, say what
Bitch I'm about to blow up
Hey I came up, I warmed up the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Now don't it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I'm blowing up and bitch I'm still me
But what's the cost to live your dreams, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money chains and whips make me feel free
I'm starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters I'm headed to that place you like to go
They say, "what you fighting for, the game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short
Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up
Yeah got to the club early just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
Man, but now it's bottles at them tables, bring the models boy I'm about to po' up
Uh huh, you know what, bitch I'm about to blow up

Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah (Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Uh huh, look I'm about to blow up)
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Momma said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree but what that cost you
You make a good salary just to pay Sally May
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehova's witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
Summers dead it got me drinking thinking bitch I better blow
I better blow,
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl what it look like
And where ya head at, and what ya cook like
She said where ya bread at, and what your whip like
You ain't got one or the other than brother good night

Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up
Yeah got to the club early just to get a friend, wait for hoes to show up
But now it's bottles at the tables bring the models, boy I'm about to po' up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah (Uh, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up)
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Bitch I'm about to blow up!

Praise God it's hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit
Well damn, why ain't you say so
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phone of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it's case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You'll never be me partner so it don't fucking matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you that's why it sounds, beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit but you know what
For now bitch I'm about to blow up

﻿[Verse 1:]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath, I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship Lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Now you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that the college point is right to
"Be All That You Can Be" posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind this, singing...

[Hook — James Fauntleroy:]
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2 — J. Cole:]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, you the only reason why I don't flip and go insane
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Hook — James Fauntleroy 2x:]
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so--- fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? You's a lying motherfucker
Jerome Lewis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit, hah

Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't no need for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!"

Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some
Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country
And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
﻿[Verse 1:]
Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it

I break down, I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2:]
I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas

Break down! We break down, we break down, we break down...

[Verse 3:]
Servin' time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Please... stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
[repeat]﻿I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1:]
You on ya job, and it damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you,
Hey baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make ya man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminded me of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parlay, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room
We call this to the hard way? Hard way!

[Hook:]
I put it down
Any spot any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in [x4]
If they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them

[Verse 2:]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like you knew Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
A stewardess yet you flew the Lear
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for you
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catching bodies
How I'm stretching you there's no need to go to Pilates
When I'm sliding thru ya city meet me in the lobby
Then you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? While you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a high way
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down!

[Hook:]
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in [x4]
If they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them

[Verse 3:]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the four seasons
Whisper to ya home girls ya love Cole world
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse
You know the type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf football
I got his girl lip-gloss all on my girth
But cause I'm so cleaver better than who ever
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's oh eleven, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up and so I had to blow and I ain't talking
Coke header, I won't let up

[Hook]Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with the bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a

[Hook]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[2Pac:]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!

California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'


Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Shake it Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco


And you know L.A. up in here

Pasadena where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good

[2Pac:]
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby

Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

[2Pac:]
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side
Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West coast, west coast﻿[Verse 1: Special]
Never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a,
Son to his mother or a sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don’t even speak, but know it’s love though
Could never let em’ dirty your name I got the utmost respect for you,
Came back home and had to check for you,
Word 'round town is you locked down
Some older niggas snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be, she like “if you was me you wouldn’t wait for me
Living fast you wouldn’t mash the brakes for me”
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook]
Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Lemme holla at you,
Yeah I know its been a while, but ain’t no better time than now
Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know its been a while, but

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me,
The day you played my momma you played me
Can’t believe I let you in my heart nigga
I should’ve, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ain’t want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops
Put me on to ‘Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who would’ve thought you’d leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga “why you lie?”
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man,
But I still I feel I won’t be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppin's
Heard you tryna’ talk to, tell that punk don’t call me
You ain’t shit and I’m scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain’t true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain’t you
Cause you ain’t lookin’ like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don’t know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, so you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla'ed but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White tee’s in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now it’s a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin’ hoes like the old days,
But now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seat
Yo my nigga can I holla at you?

[Hook]
﻿
Yeah!
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could so if I had it, never would.
Then I got my first little taste of paper, and I splurged
I guess it's just the nigga urge, this is the Boondocks
I swear yo I'm like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be trynna save the world, then on Friday I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scraping then you hear the gats blasting Damn!
older niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see I can, but I won't
Plus I'm saying what I won't
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
That's the throat, on a certified freak, while she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head so she won't remember where I live
My game is tight, baby no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life

Like Hov said it Can I Live?
Aye dear Lord, Can I live? Hey!
Now am I Living to get paid just slaves for a wage (all week)
I can't do no 9 to 5 told my momma (sorry)
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the (glory)
If you knew me know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked (for me)
I ain't pissed, naw could'ntgive a shit (hardly)
I be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me
If I go I know the ones that's pouring liquor for me
And I know the fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was bout to blow so they was waiting on me
But Oh-No, Lord
See I'm smarter then they know-oh-oh
So hold on, Lord, Cause I ain't quite ready to go-oh oh

Can I live

Somebody told me that it's only one shot, so I'll be God damn, If I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'm a make it to the top
So I'm a keep climbing to my heartbeat drop

Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude he was young like 21, strait up out that city that I'm from
A real smart Nigga, but his niggas they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breath nigga.
His partner screaming Don't you *** leave nigga!
Took off his shirt trynna stop the bleeding nigga, Don't you go!
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from befo
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord I ain't ready to go

Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?

Can I live? Yea
Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleeding
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes
Open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe?
Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screaming: "Go 2Pac!" and I ain't stopping 'til I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now nigga look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player, getting high
And when I'm rolling by niggas can't see me!

[George Clinton:]
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

[2Pac:]
Been getting word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Saying they can get with us, but picture me getting served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be bumping out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothing but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penitentiary dick
Hitting bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alize and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss playa, fuck what you thought, though
My enemies deceased, die like a bitch
When my album hit the streets, niggas can't see me!

[George Clinton (2Pac):]
(Niggas can't see me)
(They can't see me)
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

[2Pac:]
You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't killed me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle n' roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rapping bring me money, then I'm rapping 'til I'm paid
I'm getting green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star, and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart
Niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick﻿Need y'all niggas to feel me yo,
Feel my pain...
Said soft niggas can't last hard times yo,
Believe that shit.
Real niggas don't cry...
Look,
Yo...

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
Bird chest, legs skinny,
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,
Fresh pennies on my feet,
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname,
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'
Let me explain,
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained.
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle.
Niggas praying for they moms,
At the same time they moms pray for them.
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.
It hurts on the usual,
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

I sit back and watch the news every now and then,
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
Even the weathers bad.
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,
Like damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks,
some stupid niggas got him for his chain,
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait,
man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world,
got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us,
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son,
Make her wanna blow her brains out,
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness.
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,
violence, hatred, real devastation,
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,
welfare, single mothers, no jobs,
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress...
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,
but why don't black's got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days.
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain.
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain,
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry,
but I can't though...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

﻿Yeah,
Yea Yea, uh,
It's Carolina, nigga,

Yeah
Ay,
Fayettenam,
Yeah!

Listen, alive and still kickin nigga,
I survived the ville,
But a lot will not, so they will glocks and bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill,
Money hungry, tryna find a meal.
Can't stay inside and chill,
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas,
Lying like they on the pill,
Preachers say we blessed,
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal.
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will,
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel –gates,
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes,
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so,
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build.

It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel,
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill,
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel,
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill.

Yeah,
Yo, Coming home, y'all,
Listen,

At any given time, got the city on my mind,
The city on my mind,
The city on my mind,
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine,
The city, it is mine,
The city, it is mine,
At any given time, Carolina on my mind,
Carolina on my mind,
Carolina on my mind,
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine,
I'm tryna go for mine,
Hey,

Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be,
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G,
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show,
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose,
Money goes, the money come.
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things,
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks,
The Carolina way.
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay,
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say,
Cause in Carolina- we thorough,
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G borough,
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo,
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl,
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte,
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea,
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Deacon:]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like,
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing,
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring,
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend,
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!
﻿[Verse 1:]
Gimme that beat, fool
This a full time jack, no really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large
Matter fact, where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch The Sky"
But I'll be looking passed that I'm tryna touch god
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you goin' through something, this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life
This is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tall [?] I mean war like that
Yeah, straight like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
In 2010 I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate
Shall stay anonymous
Searchin' 7 continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said "just do you, nigga!"
Sure improve, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure till they know you got the stankiest stew, nigga!
I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on 4 hoes
That boy got a cold cold
He's sick con, slick on
Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah
Ooooh
Straight like that

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Why ya'll complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I don't care me and quik went to the same school
I look at the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger, but do I need em though?
I just made a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost "Me Against The World" on you motherfuckers
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
I look at your Audemars to put ya'll in time out
It's time to unveil the real and your careers bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute brother [?] and pull the wine out
Oooh, just like that﻿[Verse 1:]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix dream pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped the Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga, I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
So I heard my jeweler say, here go your chain my nigga

[Hook:]
This is chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
Chaining day, oh my chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2:]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home where niggas sit today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Hook:]
(I need you to love me, love me)
Chaining day, oh my chaining day
(I need you to love me, love me)
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

[Outro:]
Lord
This is the last time
Told my accountant, it's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me...
I said this is my last time

﻿My intuition is telling me they'll be better days
Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I like this tone..

Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I sit in silence and and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness
God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just apply this economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, prodigal son
Got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)

(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas bro...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is, this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro...[2Pac:]
Ay what time is it nigga?
("I don't know.")
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
("Hell yeah.")
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room
("Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs
("Where K and them niggas at man?")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
("Ay, y'all seen my shoes?")
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
("Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit.")
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
("Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga.")
Aw nigga, damn

[2Pac:]
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantasy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[2Pac:]
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time!
Gotta go nigga, gotta go
("Y'all know what time it is!")
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker

[Kurupt:]
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[Kurupt:]
Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'?
The only one not to leave
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
(You seem them bitches?)
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup?

[Big Syke:]
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said?
Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[Big Syke:]
Ay, it's check out time
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga?
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
C'mon man, niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundrYou had a choice today

You had a choice to day, yeah I had mine
You can't aim by the sharks and survive and dine on the oysters
Then pull ink from a squid in my pen then paint portraits
No mistakes on this side, I'm doing well on purpose
Got my first project on sale so I'm just hoping for more rent
Been lost in my thoughts and its cash and if you not talking that you can just hit me when the tour end nigga
Nigga bout this money, nigga I was hungry
I made a choice that I would make it out nigga
Nigga bout this money, nigga I was bummy
Now I fill my tummy fresh without a doubt

Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Aye, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, ain't never had to shop to get her's
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me, now the ho wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching oops nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ay
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'm a flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her
"You so tall what team do u play for?" No bitch I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber
Nigga say they pop cause they don't fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up
Bitch nigga...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm a start off with these four bars
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold balls, whoop your ass with this crowbar
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

[Hook]

[Outro: J Cole]
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my momma I spent tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'
[Cozz:]
I guess the Lord wanted more for me
Better living, more respect, nigga more money
What's more funny, is to think a bitch ever got bored of me
And now this dick got your bitch holding doors for me
It's funny, the same nigga that she say she ain't up for, she 'bout to go down on
Your belief is your downfall, that's why I'm such an outlaw
I'm tryna stay good, help me out Lord
But niggas in the hood ain't that good, what you bout boy? Shit
If I were to rob and get semi's involved
I'd be like, more like Benny from the City Of God
You know, cool, calm, collective but don't fear me at all
That nigga probably lose a finger tryna lend me an arm
Cause look, just a year ago I was sitting in my Ford Explorer
Just exploring, tryna make sure when I'm on Florence that I floor it
Now I'm touring with the talents I was born with
Cause of that, the fact she got her boyfriends in the toilet, man
She just being gorgeous
Don't you blame her, I'm just tryna get my paper
I can see these niggas later
I ain't worried bout a nigga and I ain't worried bout a hater
I'm just worrying bout my God, I just pray up to my savior
That, never that

Luckily I, luckily I ain't gotta rob me a nigga
I just did my job, now I'm living bigger
Nowadays I'm probably gon' sign me a nigga
I'm living better
I said luckily I, luckily I ain't gotta rob me a nigga
I just did my job, now I'm living bigger
Nowadays I'm probably gon' sign me a nigga
I'm living better

[Boogie:]
I guess the Lord wanted more for me
You can see that they so salty, I got shore money
Man I heard if you act broke that you probably gon' get more money
Shit, might get food stamps and add it to my tour money
It's funny niggas I grew up with and don't fuck with hit me up 'til they stop falling
Phone dead, how the fuck am I still out here shot calling
That thirsty shit ain't got you too influenced
Why won't you sip from these creative juices
Being the center of attention ain't the point of this position I'm in
It's crazy how niggas still ballin' while we droppin' these gems
Had to raise the stakes cause I seen motherfuckers eatin'
Went from bustin' into meetings, now I'm bustin' up at meetings
I be laughin' at niggas that be carrying bitches
Unless your read receipt on I know you care for them bitches
I'm playing, see up next it's you and me Cozz
It's all I really see Cozz
And I'me let 'em be Cozz and gee Cozz

[Cozz:]
Luckily I, luckily I ain't gotta rob me a nigga
I just did my job, now I'm living bigger
Nowadays I'm probably gon' sign me a nigga
I'm living better
I said luckily I, luckily I ain't gotta rob me a nigga
I just did my job, now I'm living bigger
Nowadays I'm probably gon' sign me a nigga
I'm living betterUh, got the whole city goin' crazy for me, whole world waitin' on me
Way I been recordin' lately, I'll be retired by the age of 40
Can't ignore me, you is just a hater if you hatin' on me
Y'all can quit playin', bitches sayin' "Why you single Cody?"
Cause I'm tryna stack my Pringles, shorty, I ain't fuckin' with' you hoes
Probably get a nigga killed, either that or be on Maury
Rather sit back, smoke a sack or just drink a 40
Man, this can't be life, this ain't seemin' real
I'm closer to my dreams and fantasy of chills on my skin
Gunnin' for them niggas claiming that they got the game on lock
All jokes aside I'm about to grab the key and peel
Diabetes shield, somebody sweet talk me, I don't need a deal
Rap hard, add my signature, I need at least a mil'
I'm tryna feed the children, tryin' to make at least killing
Crimes I at least repent, no snitchin'
Pigs make people squeal, keep it real
Niggas makin' it with connects and just decent skill
So with this type of hunger y'all ain't shit but some easy meals
Feelin' greasy still, holla at your boi
Name a nigga better than me, you ain't got one
I don't tell 'em that I'm sick, I let the snot run
I was poppin' on Twitter 'fore a nigga even got one

Man, the whole world waitin' on a nigga
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Got the whole world waitin' for a nigga
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
I got the whole city goin' crazy for me
I got the whole city goin' crazy for me
I got the whole world waitin' on a nigga
Man, the whole world waitin' on a nigga
I got the whole city goin' crazy for me
I got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Man, I'll be chillin' by the age of 40
Got the whole world... (waitin' on a nigga)
Got the whole world... (waitin' on a nigga)
Got the whole world... (waitin' on a nigga)
Got the whole world... (waitin' on a nigga)
Damn, uh

Hard to get grades to get into college where part of it is the party
And part of all the officers, tell 'em to get up off of us
[?] got that [?], picked it up in Los Angeles
Picked it up from anonymous, no, we not snitchin'
Man, I'm 20 years old with the tolerance of a 40 year old father with a slut
Daughter with a son that couldn't get to no colleges
What the fuck is you actin' fantastic for?
It ain't a thing for me to get to clobberin'
Nobody slobberin' like how Cozz is spittin'
Niggas is trippin', niggas is pimpin'
Niggas ain't gettin' no business, niggas is slippin'
I been tyin' my shoes
Niggas been trippin' up tryin' to win
Niggas been trippin', I'm sippin' my gin
I don't give a fuck my nigga, I'm in
Man, my...
Life, life
Been on some other shit
Who better than me
Nigga, not none
Not none
I'm just talkin' my shit
I'm the shit, bitch
Guess who waitin' for me

Got the whole world waitin' for a nigga
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Got the whole world waitin' on a nigga
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Got the whole city goin' crazy for me
Man, the whole world waitin' on a nigga

Man, the whole world...
Man, the whole city goin' crazy for me
City goin' crazy for me﻿[Intro]
This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like
When I release, trust if you think my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwin four, he throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying, "you a rappin' nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap ass nigga,
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job,
Oh, hold your horses,
If my next album flops it's back to the post office
Both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility...
The thought alone it's killing me...

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90's niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finna, drop knowledge like a five-per-center
Fuck the build-a-bird, niggas showing God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas when to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now,
Back to Hell's kitchen now,
Up in Hova office like, he's the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
Reminisce on little Jermaine, in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they was
Talk about the streets but, nigga
That ain't really where they was
Acting just like there they were
But who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga
I just like being aware
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera,
At the same time, and put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they names wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now,
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas,
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous,
Wanted to drop the album in the summer but the label didn't think that they could sell it,
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me...
I can't let it go
I can't let it go

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters
﻿[Intro:]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey hey

[Verse 1:]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha! Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?", bitch, when I feel like it

[Hook:]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy

I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here

[Verse 2:]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
bitch I made this in the crib watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook:]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy

I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here

[Outro:]
Come pull me outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey﻿[Intro]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through with drawls
Say who told you that I wanted this the
I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yea every record, shows
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Wish you prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left in the dark, blind
Mama kiss the back of me this last time

[Hook]
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mama take this motherfucking block off
Thats the date the state will take the blocks off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, This ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had told me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me some support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them god damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I tell if I stress take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection, G-O-D
No its not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, Kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, Raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand, and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
﻿Yeah,
Ay check me out man,
In case y'all niggas didn't know-
Shout out to the class of 2007,
St. John's University, stand up! (Fayetteville state, nigga)
All my North Carolina A&T Aggies stand up, UNTG man,

Fayetteville Tech.

For all my college niggas man,
For all y'all little niggas, this is why you should got to college, my nig.
Hahaha
Yeah

It's hard to picture a nigga not get money,
J.Cole living bummy? hahaha That shit is funny,
I'm focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards,
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor's,
And if this rap shit don't work, I'm going for my Master's.

Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes,
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades,
A nigga straight A's like the braze,
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain't clean,
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves,
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing,
Cause if the girl get excited, she's invited. (haha)

If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me,
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me.

Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don't, the big man on campus.
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances,
And if your ass is dumb you won't even get a chance,
Cause I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea.

And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low,
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know.
I see you haters man, but I ain't mad at y'all niggas,
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I'm ballin'!
Got a sidekick so them hoes don't be callin'!

Hit me on aim, ay what's your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga's got some mean game, yea,
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It's funny hoes I couldn't have is tryna bag me,
But I'm in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy,
She said she want it from the back, gladly.

If it's alright with you, shit, then it's alright with me, (hey)
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me,
Look, if it's alright with you, (yea) you know it's alright with me.
Yea uh

I'm skipping class just to get some ass, living fast,
And college with no sleep nigga, my jab-quick exams,
So kill that old college game, some shit we don't believe.

You mad cause your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh,
You know the G, I hit her up like "Hello Elle,
I see you looking right the other day, LOL.
So, what's good with you? "
She hit me right back like "Shit, what's good with you? "
You know I like that, so of course I write back,
Hit her with some nice chat.

Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that,
Yea I put game right, but that's your wife, nigga take her,
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)

A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish,
It ain't a weekend that I'm sober,
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship,
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

Hahahaha, wooo!

Ay, this is straight through, nigga,
No, no fucking, no double takes,
This is straight through the whole shit nigga,

Check it out man, tryna tell y'all niggas man,
College is a good look,
A real good look, my nigga,
For more reasons than one, man,
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though,
That shit like extra expensive.
I got scholarships though, so you know I'm not sweating that.
I feel for my niggas that couldn't make it man,
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah
Ay they can't, they can't keep us out the G my nigga, you know.
Then we all make it, nah, we ain't all make it.

Shout out to my niggas, man,
All my niggas, yo.
Weather you graduated or not,
Weather you made it to college or not, nigga.
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah,
Class of 2007 man,
Holla at me,
I'm going to grad school though, you know?

On the block with a soda pop and a sober watch
My time never wasted, quit playing
You know its not, planned
You know its hot, they banging and holding Glocks
Like pussy you know its cock
Talk shit like you know a lot
Your body get overshot
I need a buzz, tell Andy momma to go and shop
And quick 'fore I'm 'sposed to drop
Yeah Cozz & Effect is in effect you get affected
Cozz is sick, Cozz can cause an infection
Ooh she thick, ma can cause an erection
Fuck a thot, I don't cockblock for the best shit
But I did reminisce in skipping class to get ass from mixed batch of ladies
But lately, text full of "ifs", "ands", and "maybes"
World filled with killing, the kids having babies
So bitch pass to hemp fast, that shit has me lazy
I know that laziness a bitch, I'm trying to break the habit
But this place is full of shit, I sit, I can't stand it
Another day in Los Angeles ducking from the bandits in the cut
Under a bandage hoping they vanish goddamn it
So much evil in these streets its been like God damned it
The most civilized done got savage
Praying to my lord pleading that he make it a little easier, you know
Praying like I hope there's soul inside of me, not like the sole of my feet when I stroll through the streets

Cause this that soulful shit
This that food for less talk not that whole food shit
Nothing fake, not that tofu shit
And I don't owe you shit, but now you know
When you can't come and get it
Cause this that soulful shit
This that food for less talk not that whole food shit
Nothing fake, not that tofu shit
And I don't owe you shit, but now you know
When you can't come and get it

Made a few tracks, Usain, runnin' laps run those
If hip-hop ever falls I put it back on its toes
I was always taught to never put your back to your bros
But watch your back always they could be actual foes
Cozz Cody allow
Yeah this young black Ted
There's new niggas in the game, we just trying to get next
A little sick of school, I'd rather get this money instead
Call the cops, hit a hunger we just trying to get fed
Keep my head high when I feel low
Who tryna to roll, got all this pot fuck a stove
Tone said he gone get me on
So if you got something to say leave a message after the tone
Why ain't they acting the same?
Things really changed, so why make dollars out the remains
It's cool, nigga keep it cool with my crew
We rude never ever did follow rules, that's true

Cause this that soulful shit
This that food for less talk not that whole food shit
Nothing fake, not that tofu shit
And I don't owe you shit, but now you know
When you can't come and get it
Cause this that soulful shit
This that food for less talk not that whole food shit
Nothing fake, not that tofu shit
And I don't owe you shit, but now you know
When you can't come and get it﻿[Hook:]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin’)
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Hook]

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Hook]

You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it

[Rapsody:]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
﻿Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

(Hey Dre whats happening with it my nigga)

[Dr Dre - Verse 2]
Still I’m at it, peel the plastic off it
You could feel the magic
Still I’m laughing at the critics talking
I can see ‘em gagging when I’m back in the back of my city
Back in the back with a batch, I’m banging Dre Beats with me
Look where I’m at, it’s the murder cap’
And I’m captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It’s a wrap when I’m done
And I’ve come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mill in a day
Bitch I’m from..

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]
So come and visit, the tires screeching
Ambulance, policeman
Won’t you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki crease and crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where your sword at?
Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big, it’s Rasputia for you shooters
Kama sutra screaming fuck your position and make you hold that
I’m trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know Flex and piru crip tatts

They swarm on me like a beehive hoop in the G ride
From the west to the east side
Know just how Compton roll

[Dr Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
And that’s a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch
Of course it’s my decision
I crashed the ports that you report
That you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import them narcotics

You bought it then talked about it when crack hit the speakers
The music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record depending on what you expected
I’m sure it’s bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

[Hook]
Compton, compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Dr Dre]
So tell that gangsta throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I’mma take you on that next high
I did exactly what I wanted, that’s what made them checks fly…
In my direction, you never question when I said I…
Will be a mogul before I visit Tupac and Left Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see ya we gon test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I’m on a red eye
Flying back to my city cause I forever stand by…

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate, we can all harvest the rap artist of NWA
America target a rap market, it’s controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in, made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, 10 bottles of Rose
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every muthafucka in here say

Look who responsible for taking Compton international
I make ‘em holla oooooooh

Eh yo Just Blaze, good looking homie
(Just Blaze, just blaze)

Ain't no city quite like mine

﻿[Chorus:]
What can I?
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot

[Verse 1: J Cole]
Just one of them days
A nigga feel like flossin'
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look I'm back bitch, back with an attitude
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I'm living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', HD

[Chorus:]
(It's cost me a lot)
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
(It's cost me a lot)
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
(It's cost me a lot)
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn't get at half price
(It's cost me a lot)
Look but don't touch motherfucker, think twice
(It's cost me a lot)

Now I don't love no material things
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)
Now I don't love no material things
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask "is the plane ready?"
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn't nail him
If he could'ntsell him, so what that tell him huh?

My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl
White Range, call that Motherfucker Larry Bird
I got em hanging on every word

[Chorus]
﻿[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Sing along kids, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)

I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers
But never made that visit, if better days was on its way
Then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh yeah I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Am I right?)
Spend it all in front of the county building (oh)
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up

(Nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)

Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King
you just put your daddy on Bullis Rd.)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Please sing)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah


﻿[Verse 1: Bas]
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty Sittana, we missin ya
Even know you gone, your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas that never call me unless they need something,
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"
Running game, it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin'

[Hook x2: J Cole]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Yeah
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did,
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"
But now you saying "Man enough about you,
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?
Oh you forgot about me?"
Saying "Niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cause got yo back
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
Please let me catch up
Won't you let me catch up man"
"I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you"

[Hook]

﻿[Chorus 1 — TLC:]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round

[J. Cole:]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you're a woman, I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels; I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you can't face what's wrong; no need to fix
What God already put his paint brush on; your roommate yelling
"Why you gotta take so long?" What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[J. Cole:]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while, but I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 — J. Cole (TLC):]
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em
(You're the one that was tryna keep me way down)
(But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round...)

[J. Cole:]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail; wonder why we inhale
Cause we in hell already - I ask if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hey, hell naw - I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro — Choir:]
Ohhhhhhhhhhohoh [4x]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la [4x]
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, all you know I found my way back 'round, baby, back 'round...
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you I found my way back 'round, back 'round...
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round
﻿They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now

No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on

What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook:]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

Listen
I got a story for ya. When I was 17
I had a name that was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nothing new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin', going no where
I figured "Fuck it. It's a couple hoes here."
I might as well sign up
And climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse
Spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage
I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like i dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga
DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat
Fast. the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak
That is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger
That killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again I beg my mom for braces
Then I had a crooked

[Hook]

Growing up just a young knuckle head running wild
Momma youngest everybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile
Snagga tooth nigga for a while
Liftin up my pillow tooth fairy never came around damn
We was po, but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily
Lookin', wondering how my teeth would grow
They came slow and out of line
I couldn't comprehend the significance at the time
This crooked smile was just another sign
Saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah remember Brandy Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga sosa
I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear
J's drop. he got a fresh new pair
And there I was with hand me downs
Turned into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention with this crooked smile

[Hook]﻿[Verse 1:]
Said at what point do you start seein' bread?
Been out hustlin' for years, shoe box right under my bed.
I moved the work out my momma house got me a lil ol' crib
I always fantasized if I had went to college instead.
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best.
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek, I'm better off dead.
Cuz fuckin' with this white its all been downhill like a sled.
Now I understand they say you make your own bed.
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread?
In denial 'bout the feds, he can't see past bread.
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone.
Inside me Lord I know its a lie that we gon' be fine
But mama I'm tired of cryin', just lie to me one more time
Cuz it's crunch time

[Hook]
Cuz it's crunch time
Shit real man, a nigga got bills
Dog it's crunch time
It's crunch time
Shit real man, a nigga got bills

[Verse 2:]
Look, scavenge these records of these days, MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for niggas with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holdin' on to the word maybe
Cuz this 9-5 shit is driving you stir crazy
Comin home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollin' 'bout your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet,
Maybe some feedback on these raps
Cuz labels ain't hollerin' and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody sees your vision, they walkin 'round blindfolded
All this time holdin on to possibilities,
You step outside, smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze.
Fuck what they talkin'! It ain't like life come often.
The only thing worst than death is a regret filled coffin.
So try before you die, or always wonder "what if?"
I thank the Lord for this wonderful gift.
Lookin' for strength in this crunch time. [2x]

[Hook]
﻿[Verse 1]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck yo girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?",
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"

[Hook]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
[x2]

Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2]
Can I get a witness, this is Shawty mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so then roll it up,
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"

[Hook]
Hey, and blow a couple stacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
[x2]

Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

﻿Give me my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding?
I’m for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?
I’m glowing, knowing that the flow intact,
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first mil I’m blowing that
Now, like fuck it I know I’ll grow it back, shit, it’s nothing,
Funny how blacks spend their money on mad shit for stuntin
But shit, that’s all we know man, thats how a niggas raised
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid
And you should be gettin laid by the time you in ninth grade,
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea.
In class dreamin bout having these nice things
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin
But them whites ain’t
I brush it off like, “fuck it, it’s motivation,”
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take ‘em
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan,
But fuck it man, I ain’t hatin, I gotta go for mines.
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime,
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Fortunes,
I’m focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I’m tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won’t pay ‘em attention,
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition,
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition,
While these fake niggas ain’t into doing, they into wishin,

Til I’m rich, ain’t no reason to settle nigga,
It's greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese,
You niggas couldn’t think at my level, even with trees,
You couldn’t get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please,
I’m chasing G’s tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze,
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves.
Ease to the top and I’m not finna leave til I’m hot,
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga,
Boy, I’m shining without the diamonds in my mouth,
Out grindin while you reclining on your couch,
I’m climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt,
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo mouth,
And you gonna find what I’m about, nigga
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain’t gonna parlé with y’all,
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher,
but check, them checks is all a nigga thinking,
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
﻿[Verse 1:]
Yea Fayettenam
Uh, these niggas is playing Russian roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless naw we don't dance all we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck-Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yea, I operate on a higher plain, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these hoes ? wanna text-us like Waco
It's hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for!?
Some next niggas almost slide in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kid-in?
These big weight niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress
I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow
Or you catapult
Not if I had a ladder or not even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus:]
(I'm out for presidents to represent me nigga!)
I out or president to represent me, yea!
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me! The warm up!
Yea, the warm up! yea the warm up
(This is, the warm up!)

[Verse 2:]
Ay, look heaven or hell you choose
Freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop em as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these hoe-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be Lebron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
I'll with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies Bs but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, Ay is it destiny or is it money your feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Ay five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these whack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm trynna live it how no other niggas ever lived it!

[Repeat Chorus:]

I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!
I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!
I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!
Dead fucking presidents to represent me!
The warm up!
Yea, yea yea yea yea yea! the warm up! yea yea yea yea the warm up hey!
Fayattenaaaam! nigga yea!, Carolina all day!
Yea!

Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

I know you were made for me but

Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her﻿Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focussed and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to the gate
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
Damn, these niggas that much better than me?
Baby, I don't think this is meant to be
cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said huh
I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
and I'ma get it

Ok, I got this chick enthralled, slippin' out her draws
Stick it in her jaw first then I'm in her snatch like I'm dippin' with this broad, purse never comin' back
Cuttin' like a barber stupid niggas spoiled her
But I'm a G see? Luke I am your father
Vader how I son these niggas, cater how I serve these niggas
Big beard, Al-Qaeda with the fuckin' clippers
Six gears y'all chasin' when we fuckin' dip in
Pop my clip and shoot my shot
Got her butt naked in my fuckin' kitchen, alfredo what she cookin'
Light a blunt when we want a killin' of the good shit
Niggas front, I got a couple hittas up in Brooklyn
So they can go to hell they haters
Catch me a fine honey, bag two bitches in the elevator
We'll celebrate her penetrate her, shit cold
Top floor, you ain't got the code for the elevator
Shine like a laminator so the hoes wanna stronghold
Hit 'em with the arnold, part one, two, three I'm a terminator
Salvation week and honestly man, the last couple weeks
Light the gas on the beat, like a pass from the heat
James, Wade, Bas I'm a G, no stage name
Ties on the street we bang, bang
Eyes on the prize so my mind run in circles
Try and go for mine and I'll fuckin' hurt you
Moms was a dime? then I probably birthed you
Gave you a style boy now it's time for curfew
Sleep tight, see the light of day
Sticky finger face time, Onyx with technology
School I used to waste time, but I know biology
And I know my chemistry, bet I know my math
I will solve the task, pushin' somethin' foreign with 200 on the dash
When they call ignore 'em if it ain't about the cash
Shorty got it goin', she amazin' with the ass
Bas lap these rappers like I'm tapin' down the gas
Pedal to the metal, New York City prince, rose pedals for the fellow
This is hella instrumental, shit, I had to go and get a rental

﻿A dolla and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I’m all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A
Why a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain’t never cry, baby, fuck him, that’s life
And trust me I’m living,
Look what a nigga made out,
The shit that I was given,
Look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes,
Man, our hoes couldn’t put this flame out.
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall,
I’m from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols.
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y’all,
I thank the Lord He let a nigga make it this far,
A lot niggas don’t, a lot of moms weep.
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me.
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me.
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee,
I pour liquor, homie

It’s foul, but yo the world keeps spinning,
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen,
Nigga Imma eat, even if it means sinning,
Niggas want beef, Imma sink my teeth in ‘em
Pause, I go harder, I'm all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I’m a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain’t stopping ‘til my money is long,
So much dough, them hoes will think I’m rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, “Honey, I’m home.”
Cooking greens for a nigga, give ‘em plenty, a dome.
It’s funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it,
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality,
The ville is a trap nigga now,
And if you ain’t focused you gonna be here for awhile,
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun,
Type a nigga know about every car, but don’t got one.

That’s hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils,
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I’m tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself,
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf,
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate,
And Ville niggas can relate, man.
My niggas know about the struggle, man.
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit.
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes.
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad.
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo,
I wanted that shit soooo bad.
I begged my mom for that shit, you know.
But she couldn’t afford it, yo, she gave me,
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh,
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits,
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn’t,
Niggas ain’t even know he was broke man, no worries and shit.
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills,
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma

﻿Hey, hey, yea, yea

Ay, I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team

Niggas hatin' but I love them even though they trynna scheme
But I'm past that, a niggas stock is raising like the Nastec
They same I'm the future but yet I'm giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days, when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga I say what they never say
Whenever they, spit that bullshit they spittin,
this that pool pit I'm hittin niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dolla in my pocket, plus a dream
Yea you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I'll tell you what them scares like
I'm speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mails I feel like Cartwright, bills
Forreal, a nigga I'll
Just let me do the talking men I know how niggas feel

I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no hoe, and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog, and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, so white man can jump
They shooting niggas fo' they even tell em put their hands up!
Crooked cops, got a nigga scared to drive probably thinking
that I'm slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dolla plus a dream
Yea you swear your girl is faithful everything ain't what it seems
See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst
I bet if I was to hit men, I wouldn't be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get from the Bible, for your survival

[Chorus:]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
[4x]

Check it
Ay Salle, I know I ain't been answering your calls, but shit, let me explain-
It's because times been hard, been runnin around trynna find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o'clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got cha letters laying in my dresser draw
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you,
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know one day in my heart that I'm gonna pay you back"
I got a dolla and a dream﻿[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress and this mess you're in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen po'
Mr Dolla and a Dream in case you ain't know

That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
You paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies; who infiltrated my team?
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
You never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "God damn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like "Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages

I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

Threes in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal

Aye, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get your freestyles ready!

﻿Yeah! Uh!
Yeah, you gotta look,
You gotta follow me, what I'm doin' rite here mayne
Like when I say this shit is crazy,
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin', it's actually crazy,
Nah'mean
Yeah!

Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait, is-
Is fate procrastinating?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's

This is the girl of my dreams, yeah
Ay, is she good as what she seems?
Uh, or am I lying to myself?
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams
Is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay, should I try and get some help?

Yeah, yeah
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her
Like all the way home without her knowing
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave to me,
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

This the girl of my dreams
Hey, ay is she good as what she seems?
Uh, or am I lying to myself?
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay, should I try and get some help?

Yeah, yeah, look
I spot her walking in the mall, okay, it's time to grow some balls
If she really gon' be yours, oh my god, I'm walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,
"Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch,
Some R&B and rap, ay you should come thru"
She said, "uh, I love too, except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that"
Damn! Man,
Okay, you say you got a man,
I mean, I definitely understand, I'm happy for you, really am,
I couldn't have been the only fan in the world Of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme to get

The girl of my dreams
Uh, ay is she good as what she seems?
Uh, or am I lying to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Ay is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay should I try and get some help?

Yeah, yeah
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?
I'm a follow in my car; I'm a cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

This the girl of my dreams
Is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay should I try and get some help?
Ay, this is the girl of my dreams
Is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Think I should I try and get some help?

Haha
Yeah
Aye!Yeah, shit nigga, we all dream, nigga
Yeah, we're just tryna make sure they come true, feel me?
Dreams of being rich, uh?
Yeah, yeah, ha, yo!

Always had dreams of being rich, uh?
Momma never thought I'll make it this way
Bitches really on my dick now
When I think about it, ain't shit changed
We had dream of being rich, wow!
We really dreams of being rich, wow!
Momma never...
Yo, yo...

Imagine if I stopped rhymin' and settle for top ramen
Got content with the crib that my pop's lie in, never stop moppin'
On that nine to five job shit, fuck that!
I'd rather go comic and go to Gotham
And meet with Batman and start robbin'
Killin' get started, heart throbbin' be cautious
If you come across this instrumental's carcass
It may leave you nauseous
Cause when I'm on it, it's guaranteed death, why?
Cause we always had dreams of being rich
Rollie on my arm, Jesus' pieces on my neck
Momma needin' the rent, Poppa drinking a fifth
Crash my Momma's Honda, can't even lease her a whip
Stress is hell, but you couldn't tell, even if you snitched
Smiling, always see him with a grin
But I came to raise hell, boy, and evil is within man
All I know, is that bitch better have my money
Cause money issues have your mom's act funny with'you

We had dreams of being rich, uh?
Always had dreams of being rich, wow!
Bitches on my dick now
When I think about it, ain't shit changed

I'm trying to get my money pass so closer to a pharaoh's
I know that I can get close I'mma show her I'mma get dough
Nigga I don't ride, I get chauffered on the metro
Poor nigga, rich mind, it won't hurt if you let go of reality I'm searching for a battle, jeez
But no one's here to challenge me
Throwin' a lot of shots and they fatal ones
Trust no nigga, even the devil had a halo once
The demons carry angel dust, stressin' I know
I got to pick my ankles up but this lean in this Sprite soda got me talking like Yoda
Don't ever live my life sober
Oooh, I love it when they doubt me
Cash right where my mouth be, check my stomach for the hunger
Don't laugh at the outie
My boy frank in the Audi
Scoop me up we outtie, bumpin' music loudly, crazy how lousy these niggas soundin'
I heard these niggas talkin' and never talk around me
Nigga you listen to Casey Veggies, you ain't about beef
Are you scary? But I'm more than scary
To the ordinary storytelling motherfucking author
Cooking up some shit your stomach could never process
My apron dirty really need to wash it
Cause Cozz is heading to the top
Watch whenever my shit drop I don't know when
But I'm never counting losses
Only counting my profit, nigga stop it
Got niggas noz sick

Motherfucker always had
Dreams of being rich, wow!
Always had dreams of being rich, uh?
Momma never thought I'd make it this way
Momma never thought I'd make it this way

I know we got dreams of being rich
The rollie on my arm, the pieces on my neck
Poppa needin' a rent[Verse:]
Since my niggas facin probation we gon smoke they faces off
Wish that we can smoke and smoke until we burn them cases off
I'm not too proud about, not much to smile about
It's like they never took them fuckin braces off
Gunshots... but ain't no fuckin races start
Either play your part and play it apart or play it raw, hole in 1
Few hunned yards, you a superstar groupies heart
But yo lady got the truest heart
I'm on the verge of greatness, patience is the only virtue
But for the moment I'll be... overindulging, I see
Gracious faces, greener passes, gold chains, purple fumes
Couple niggas still breathing but to me RIP
I give niggas a shovel, tell em "get to digging, you ain't finished?
Til that hole is big enough for you to fit in"
I don't need credit, I don't need a fuckin credit limit
Me and my team travel like we never learn to pivot
And spend it in cities where bitches numbers be like 21 digits
How I'm supposed to dial that when I'm high as that, hah?
How was such a chilly breeze flowin from yo eye and flash
I thought fire breed new life but niggas is dying... fast

[Bridge - Angela]

[Hook:]
I'm on a pill, think I love this bitch - that's how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that's the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain't numb and under this I could feel it still

[Bridge - Angela:]
Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moments
Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moments
Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moments

I'm on a pill, think I love this bitch - that's how real it feel

Save up the moments
Keep you close to my heart
Keep you close to my heart

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yea, this is where the
Yea, this is where the fathers ain't living
At least not with us
Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small time nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's
For that Robert Deniro, niggas reload on them kilo's
Dodgin them people,
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where the boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a strecther and though I never met ya
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya
Man, don't let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya
(We miss ya)

[Hook: J. Cole]
Come with me,
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la

Come with me,
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yea, let's see God
I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny
They always tellin' me it's temporary
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here
You heard me say I was ballin'
I probably make tears
I'm trying to get clear
I'm tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here
These kids live there whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes
But I'm tryna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
Cause I ain't dying
My words gon' last forever,
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen
I think I'm in the Dungeon Fam, I see lo green
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings
(No kings, no kings)

[Hook: J. Cole]
Come with me,
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la

Come with me,
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya
I face the sky and hope to God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side
Where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out
But will it change, it's like niggas is free but our minds still in the chains
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame
Will it ever slow up
Alot of niggas getting older but they never grow up
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the season nigga no re-runs
The devil buying soul's nigga no refunds
Man, don't let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya
Another day, another song, a mother prays
Another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
Cause ain't nothing wrong
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall
But before I pass
I gotta ball
I gotta ball
I gotta ball
Nigga I gotta ball﻿Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus]

[Punch]
Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it...
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it
﻿Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

Look, some niggas let their dirt out
Some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade. A part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I'll bury with me when I'm gone
When my story's told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint?
Glorify me, over-think? Say they know me, say I'm great?
Say I'm phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated
Just a nigga with a dream
I'm a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I'm gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn't nothin' but a man

This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now Im blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin' how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I'm blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can't forget my past and hope it won't forget me
Got good grades but A's can't stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don't wait for me
Cause I'm trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I'm gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
Its hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I'm not gon change a thing
I swear I'm not gon change a thing

This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah
﻿A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Schoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
as I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothing is surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar
﻿[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]

Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved﻿[Rick Ross]
You know I stick to the script
Twenty-million dollar nigga, but I do it like this

I’m a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff, Simpson-Rodgers, my last cup
On this shit, I can’t stand up, country Ks as I man up

Fuck hoes wit’ no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin’
Out in Sweden, like ain’t shit that you can’t tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
‘Cause uh, they had them Js, and my mama wouldn’t cop ‘em
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches wann’t a option
Now we livin’ much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about ‘em forever

You just need to know I’m comin’, I’ll kill you niggas this summer

M-M-M-Maybach Music﻿I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I, walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I—I see a lot on your plate
9 months with that weight
I know you tired so, I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer, oh
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice of being present
There's no where I need to be, except right here with you
Except right here with you
Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day I'm drinking almond milk
You soft!

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
That's so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

If I can make life easier, the way you do mine
Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax, let you recline babe
Then I should do it, cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things
Now say, "I love you", it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Got learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say "Damn what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)
Little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-t-took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)
Uh huh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check? And if so
You gotta expect to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee "the finisher"
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run,
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All in my line like calling number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, tryna get that taste of the heaven, or hell... only time will tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double XL
Or Fader, fuck a magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'm a drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death. Blah.

Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[J. Cole:]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated with powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated with powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my nigga - I hope you listening
I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking 'ville I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got perscription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-Tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be pimpin'
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milley Vanille with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep overseas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stayin' silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs why won't you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

And ever since we hit Depression niggas don't know how to act
In fact, there go some niggas there
Hatin I feel the stare
Me vs. you shining, that's like a diamond and silverware
Let ya'll feel the glare I gotta go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down

So who changed?
What's in a name though, when niggas can't hang on your shoe strings
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Lou Cain
Even in the winter, we bring, feelings of summer, Suzanne
We get them hooks like T-Pain and scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me? I'm just a boy straight out the Ville
These wanksta ass niggas gettin played out forreal
You actin like you trill nigga you betta not
You talkin out yo' ass you finna get your head rocked

Yea - hey - yea
﻿Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute,
Yea
Yeah
Uh,
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started,
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists,
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded,
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas. (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas,
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures. (ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am,
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man.
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess,
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay.
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes,
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes.
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow.
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04,
No disrespect to my favorite player,
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich,
So I'm slaying niggas, yea.

[Chorus:]
This is for my niggas tryna make it,
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh,
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail,
Living in a world where we set up to fail,
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it.

Niggas in the streets, no,
Niggas blessed beats,
I got that priest flow, heavenly.
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock,
Just a figure a speech for the glock,
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot. (yea)
Like our beats yo, it's hot,
Niggas laid out,
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out,
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate,
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth,
Just made out, came out the woodworks,
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork.
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf,
Fake money, scared money, never make money,
And a nigga never fear nothing but God,
Fuck a facade,
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit,
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit,
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six,
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit,
Nigga I,
Yea,

[Chorus:]
This is for my niggas tryna make it,
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh,
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail,
Living in a world where we set up to fail,
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it.

Tell em Geppettos my niggas is ghettos with scarface dreams,
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen,
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screams,
Watching cops loving car chase scenes,
Niggas arrested,
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested.
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested.
All created equal looks like equal to a less than,
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man.
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man,
I hate to see the position my niggas left in,
Slay dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage,
Ashamed,
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit,
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though,
Instead they wanted us to break,
They never wanted us to make it, yea,
To my niggas smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga!

﻿Up up and away...
Do you trust me...
Would you love me...
Then it must be...

[Verse 1:]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
You niggas so last summer
Onto the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs

[Hook:]
Did you miss me?
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift
God's Gift
God's Gift
Motherfucker this is God's gift

[Verse 2:]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn't put his hands on a nigga
I ain't bitter boy that's all you
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I'll survive on my own

[Hook:]
Did you miss me?
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift
God's Gift
God's Gift
Motherfucker this is God's gift﻿Fuck it,
Ay,
Do or Die, new arrival,
Holla at my niggas,
You survive you's alive, yo,
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival.
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing.
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto,
Money coming soon, the newest model,
Your crew is hollow,
The type of niggas got more dick, chew and swallow.
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal,
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up.
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks,
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up,
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts," uh,
More sluts once the money blows up,
But them hoes stop if the dough drops,
I won't stop though, a chip off the 'ol block.
I'm from a city where niggas hole blocks,
Leave you looking like old socks, damn,
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us,
The boys is rotten, I know they want us,
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus,
You kill a nigga, get promoted,
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas,
So much I just go nuts,
Niggas telling me slow up,
Remember that,
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at,
Y'all don't hear me,
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo,
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry,
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts,
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq,
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back,
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats,
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks,"
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo,
They got streets in the city police won't even go,
Peep it though, uh,
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big,
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh,
Niggas know my stylo, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though,
Have your daddy looking for you,
This ain't Finding Nemo though.
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned,
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born.
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign,
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!

﻿[Intro]
Hollywood Cole, go
Ay Hollywood, ay Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood

[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Hook]
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Hook]
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick woah

[Verse 2]
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
(This is the part that the thugs skip)
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing

[Pre-Hook]
To the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Bridge]
Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Sing this song yeah, song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

[Verse 3]
(The make up) This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho﻿[Verse 1]
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
And finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
? or cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say proof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time when I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack, I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time on lye
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

[2Pac:]
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin'
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation, but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control, I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylactics
For protection so my fuckin' sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an, MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MC's, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres
Like Hitler, stickin' up Jews with German Lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my Clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Lyrical gats spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Flip MC's like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it
I'm the one pushin' the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafeller for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for 9-nickel
[Cozz:]
I just had a sip of Grey Goose, yeah
I just had a sip of Grey Goose
Don't matter if you tell the truth
Probably still won't believe you, yeah
I just had to do what I do
I just had a sip of Grey Goose
Just cause they saying on me, I'm the truth
I just had a sip of Grey Goose
I just had a sip, I just had a sip
I just had a sip, I just had a sip

You know they know my name so you know they ain't
And dawg I ain't no hoe but I gotta know
Which one of you hoes coming to my home
Cause I've been off my motherfuckin' shit lately
I just got off stage, bitches went crazy
They don't know my name so they call me baby
I just gotta do what I gotta do
They say when I spit I take 'em way back
They say when I'm in I go way back
I just had a sip, I just had a sip
You just runnin' game, you ain't gotta play
But she's gon' stay, fuckin' with the motherfuckin' man
She know here the real niggas at
Real dawg nigga, no gas
You know where I be baby, hit you and I'm back

I just had a sip of Grey Goose
You know I'ma do what I do, yeah
They know I'ma always tell the truth
Give a fuck about what they tell you
I just had a sip of Grey Goose
You know I'ma do what I do
Just because they say it don't mean it is the truth
I just had a sip, I just had a sip

She said, "yeah I gotta know
Am I the only one that the address to your home?
Am I the only one that you seen naked in the pool?
Am I the only one that roll a blunt and pass to you?"
I said you already know that's that new nigga in the game
So you already know that I be fuckin' up, but I got a new flow
Don't matter where you at, them hoes gon' know
Cody at the motherfcukin' back of your door
Knockin' real hard, let a nigga come through
Yeah I got some weed, baby, If you're feelin' low
Yeah I some drink, baby, if you wanna pour
Nigga got some cash, now a nigga not poor
Niggas always hate, but them niggas don't know
I am now no star, baby I am from another galaxy
Them niggas they mad at me
Jealousy is such a shit

I just had a cup of Grey Goose
You know I'ma do what I do
You know that I gotta stay true, yeah
I just had a cup of Grey Goose
You know I'ma do what I do
I just had a cup of Grey Goose
So even if you don't tell the truth, yeah﻿Now I was dreaming bout a deal at the age of 13
I was feignin for the meals, I ain't talkin Burger King.
Some of my niggas in the 'ville all they did was serve things.
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing.
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting.
All they wanted was some waves like they fuckin surfin.
Hold up now, don't get it twisted I ain't hatin, do ya thing.
I was like a young Simba, couldn't wait to be the king.
Now a nigga is the prince.
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener.
Look at Shorty ass way meaner.
Somethin like Sarina mixed with Trina have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Edina.
My money like a senior, watch it graduate.
Now it's time to eat, I'm lettin all my niggas grab a plate.
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies.
These niggas heard about me now they actin like they know me.
Keep on sayin, where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.
Ey where ya goin nigga.
Ey, it ain't no tellin.
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga.
It ain't no tellin.
Can't tell ya where I'm goin.
Just know I won't stop.
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.

Pardon the interruption.
A proper introduction is necessary, when your shit is legendary.
Man, greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria and.
Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian.
The hoes is librarians, they lookin me up.
She got a Jones like Marion, she lickin me up.
Then we cut, look at how she say my name.
I got her moanin J. Cole, they used to say Jermaine.
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin.
Six feet, shits deep.
I was low, just a dolla and some hope, fix me.
Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser.
Lord please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer.
I'm a star, Converses conversin with them girls with them curves like cursive.
They open like curtains, cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio.
Same bitches used to play me though.
Now they yellin, where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.
Ey where ya goin nigga.
Shit, it ain't no tellin.
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga.
It ain't no tellin.
Can't tell ya where I'm goin.
Just know I won't stop.
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.

I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back.
Told my niggas, Ey I'm finna put the 'Ville on the map.
I'll be back, and I'm comin with a deal and a plaque.
Cause I'm I'll bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap.
Pourin liquor for my niggas that was kissin em back.
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap.
Hold up now, don't get it twisted, if you slang do ya thang.
Me I'm like a young Simba, I can't wait to be the king.
Witness the dream.
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up.
In the city where the skinny niggas tryin to be the ballers.
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryin hit they daughters.
Sneakin in the crib, but her momma never caught us.
What they taught us, man them bad bitches only want the ballers.
To start us, We hoopin, now them hoes want to guard us.
Uh, ok so play D, know what I mean.
And I, I, I put ya on the team.
And this life is but a dream.
And I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.
Ey where ya goin nigga.
Shit, it ain't no tellin.
They say this life is but a dream.
Well I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.
Ey where ya goin nigga.
It ain't no tellin.

Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?

[Verse 1:]
Okay, I'm back on a mission
To pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass
What you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class
Hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny
Back in '08 I crashed
With my foot on the gas
Thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears
Asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she's just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor
Borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas (What?)
Gold diggers, Crys sippers (What?)
Cold nigga, flow sicker (What?)
Muthafucka, I'm a fuckin' head bussa go
Coming down on the strip liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But errthing that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener I've been told
She told me, boy you want your cake and eat it too
I said it's cake, that's what your supposed to do

[Verse 2:]
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she askin my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up get dough
See I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on tv, I pray she don't break down
She strong but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new thangs
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains
In a new Range
She tellin' me so much has happened
Would've thought you changed
We ain't fuck in nine months it's safe to say I'm due man

[Hook]
﻿[Intro:]
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite... Elite
Ya know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar,
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead,
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

[Chorus]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you know about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
A dolla and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but naw I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah

[Chorus]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you know about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey
Hey Suge, what I tell you, nigga
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right
Watch this
Hey Quik, let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars
Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Eternally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men

The hearts of men

My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
But motherfucker if ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga
Look inside the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke' em, fire and bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugging is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scared up, but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake
What will it take ?
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
Cause I've been sent
The hearts of menSimply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation 
Across the nation, Mr. I-Get-Around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven!
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Heaven ain't hard to find

Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes 
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug? 
And have you ever made love 
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven!
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Hea-ven! It ain't hard to find

You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that?
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker,
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin 
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven! Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find)
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
(Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize)
Hea-ven! Hea-ven! Hea-ven. Heaven
Hea-ven! It ain't hard to find
Hea-ven! Heaven
It ain't hard to find
It ain't hard to find
It ain't hard to find﻿Mo' liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, How u love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now cummin'
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin'
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I'm repeating and I'm three-peatin'
And I'm knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep sinkin'
The label heat seekin', nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin'
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

I'm heavy
Lil nigga I'm heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Carolina I'm heavy
In New York I'm heavy
Out in LA I'm heavy
I'm so heavy

We got more liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Do you love that?

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don't wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated
fuckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated

I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil nigga in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayettenam nigga I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil nigga I'm heavy
﻿[Hook:]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

[Pre-Hook]

Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back [x9]
Everything's so sad when you look back

On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

Settle down one day this is practice
Where every coach is a model or an actress
Fiend
I just wanna meet some lawyer bitches
Fuck that, I just wanna meet some loyal bitches
So like Christmas Eve I just toy with bitches
Got hoes on beans like they Goya bitches
I, Minnesota bitches
Destroy the bridges
But you won't see my shoes wet
What you sayin ain't paid my due yet?
Well, fuck boi I be on the road still puttin work in the Duet
Fuck nigga, can you hear it? Me and your bitch gon sing a duet (La- La- La- La)
No hero to them hoagies
Cause hoes get loose like bogies
If my nigga ask for it he could have her, I could only have two left
Broads all look from afar see the same view
Could accept who you are till they change you
Can't lose what you ain't choose
As far as I see it

[Outro x2:]
Ironic, I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now let's go
And fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)

And what's Joy without no pain
Hey yeah

[Verse: J. Cole:]
The city fucked up even thug niggas getting robbed.
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station filling out the applications but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Pay checks spent on necklaces
Down payments on the Lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimist
Cause there ain't no holding me back, huh
The little nigga had big dreams to do big things
But in this thing everything ain't what this shit seems
Trying hard to come up in the flag pole just to
Find out your heroes is some assholes
But there ain't no hlding me back
﻿[Talking]
[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don't feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally
And everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself if I was gone who would remember me?
It's hard to tell
Oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessey
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why?
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my mama I'd make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know there's more to life
Than macking hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sorta like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they balling like the dream team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm trying to get
Follow me nigga I'm on the prowl
Headed to the top
You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold it down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)

[Verse 2]
You was my nigga from the younger days
We grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man
I'm sitting reminiscing on
All of them bitches we was tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink
We trying to bag some new hoes
And if I needed gear you'd let me hold your new clothes
And vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man
A nigga slow caking
I'm broke trying to chase a dream
You just got probation
And I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant
What's next?
Oh shit, my mama doing drugs
At times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness
I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when your mama tried to beat you with that bat?
Shit, remember your chick Nina?
Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina?
Yo she's still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you
It's been a while
Until the next time I hear from you
Aye, hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold it down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)

[Verse 3]
These is tough times baby
But we'll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top
I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling
Ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind
It's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit
Sometime I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don't want me to be no star though
There's groupies after every show
You scared I'm fucking every hoe
And girl I ain't 'gon lie and say I won't
'Cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength
I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids
The love is real
And if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still
So when I'm on the road don't trip
You know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don't slip
And hold it down for me

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
And hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down) [x3]

Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for ya, nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
Ya could never be live
Until you die
See the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)

[(2Pac) Nanci Fletcher:]
(Gotta be afraid, don’t let the evil of the money trap me)
(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
(So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[2Pac:]
Curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
It's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members that call the fifty states
To keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate?
To live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
So much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared, cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see come fuck with me, I give that ass a try!
Nigga, Holla at me

[(2Pac) Nanci Fletcher:]
(Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[2Pac:]
I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin' just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' cause hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
Cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust; a no no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po po
Holla at me
﻿Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh,
Yeah,

I'm I-95 cruising, with the sun in my eyes,
In the south, dog, my momma ain't seen her son in awhile,
Yea, I'll sure is,
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks,
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins,
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit.
Yea, so nigga watch it!
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets,
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap,
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, Cause,
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay,
You niggas is hatin, ' just be happy I ain't changed.
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing,
And that's- money to feed us, yup,
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yea, If I never...
Nigga, man,
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga,
Cause uh,
Na na na
Now I'm a always come home,

Where a nigga was shown,
How to scrap, yup,
Shown how to mack, yup,
Sold a whole lot of crack, yup,
Juggling them hoes,
There was a whole lot of that, yup,
Momma work to the bone,
Putting clothes on my back,

Yea,

Yea yeah,
Shout to the whole ville!
Of course, so real!
Uh,

If I never went home again,
"Hello?, chill out nigga, what's up, boy?
Yeah, I just touched down man,
I'm over off Ramsey and shit,
Aiight, well look,
I'm about to go check out my mom's man,
What's jumping for tonight?
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga."﻿Hey, this is the story of a young'n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you've been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon' be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays

Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don't know me no more
Girl, please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don't give it up in the meantime

Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays

Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A's
Hey if you're listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z ay what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know

﻿
K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail.
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone

[Hook:]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

[Hook]

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

[Hook]

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me - Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Hook]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real

[2Pac:]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk?
Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor
It's like erotic
Ironic, cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin'' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Hook]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real

[2Pac:]
Raised as a youth
Tell the truth, I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof
Cause I jumped from the roof
'fore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major - my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gonna see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?﻿Whats love got to do, go to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

(How high)

Whats love got to do, go to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

[Verse 1]
Visionary play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that
My poetry’s deep now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back on the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky bitch you figure out flying

[Chorus]
Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick, so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick, so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[Verse 2]
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl
Think I need to quit trying ‘fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the karma sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’ out, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something

[Chorus]

No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tention gets thick than there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind

How high, la la la la
how high, hey hey hey
how high, yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high, la la la la

Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, you’re friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your projects to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, that's real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J

How high
How high
How high, yeah
How high, yeah

What's love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it

﻿How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump 6, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for 10 Rand [apprrox $1 USD], stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus - James Fauntleroy:]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus]

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"

[Ronald Isley:]
I wash my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs ﻿
Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother

I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

(Crazy)
(What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy

When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy

One day at a time, uhh

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

(Offstage Argument)
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic- TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dawg
On the dead homies. Charlie P, you know that bro
You know that
It's mando. Right, it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac- enough said, enough said
We gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'm a dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'm a break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit 'cha
I ain't mad at 'cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'mma send this one out for y'all, know what I mean?
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha

[2Pac:]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a Jheri Curl didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh you's a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at 'cha)

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha

[2Pac:]
We used to be like distant cousins
Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'
Knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad
I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'
"Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
Cause you's a down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha

(a true down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha)

[2Pac:]
Well guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at 'cha
﻿See y'all don't understand me
My plan be is to win y'all hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
the way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci manhood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am

Uh, I used to to wanna by like Michael Jordan
Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
that every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee
They say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87
With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A billion bucks, and that's why

She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe
Uh, so give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You niggas' check's cash
And I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off rap
Ay, that lil' nigga got it going on
G5, going-going-going gone
Cloud nine mind state

Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Okay, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga
When I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga

﻿[Verse 1:]
I woke up early in the mornin' hoes blowin up my phone
Ain't use to small talkin' when they know I'm Tryna bone, Fuck em'
I'll holla later man, right now my mind else where
My moms health care get her out this hell here 
Alot of niggas fail, but frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man niggas can't even spell scared 
A fresh prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worried bout my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight I throw the wifey in some dolce
and put some chains on my niggas like own slaves
I get up look out the window hope the sun shining down on a nigga outhere front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out here locking up some older head
So god damn homey hold ya head (And hold ya head)

[Chorus:]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma ya son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though 
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...
Headed for the sky I'm on my way

[Verse 2:]
Paint a picture and show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison 
Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in hades where it ain't' no hope
Ain't no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout' problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk bout change still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm suppose to feel when the president spoke
When he ain't neva had to struggle ain't neva been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government like trustin' the devil in oath
A rebel with quotes
I get up
Life style of the young black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions
Like tell me why ain't got shit
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxic
As I sip

[Chorus:]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma ya son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though 
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...
Headed for the sky I'm on my way

[Verse 3:]
Yeah
To all my niggas paper chasin'
I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin' this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck in my mind but to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'm a find a way
Cause hey
Dammit them jobs outthere ain't tryna pay
I pray
Granted 9 to 5 is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my momma in rides
I'm a provide for my seed I'm the soil
I teach em' bout' loyalty
I teach em' that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I show em' all the things that my pops was neva showin' me
Treat em' like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seeds got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Chorus:]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma ya son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though 
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...
Headed for the sky I'm on my way
Chill
We could just smoke
We could just chill, we could just smoke
You know!
Yeah, yeah
Uh

Get your fine ass in that water, baby
Don't get all bougie, don't get all crazy
Roll that doobie, but don't get lazy
Show them boobies, you sexy ladies
I get it, I get it, it's Monday
Whoa, get it together one day, but why wait five days for Friday don't worry 'bout my name
I'm the motherfucking man
Nigga, you should ask around, South Central the town
Home school, it be Crenshaw
To my blood niggas, nothing against ya'll
I got love for you all, but no love for the broads
So if I am in your plans, hope my dick is involved
Come on
Sexing us all, but she waiting on a ring like she expecting a call
I'm setting the bar
Hating niggas like "He the man forreal?"
Silly motherfucker, doesn't cancer kill?
How is that for real?
Sit back and chill, Cody Macc is here
I'm trying to make it rain in that sunny weather
Trying to get more change than Armageddon
Picky now-a-days, if you ugly, Uh-uh
I like older hoes, 'cause they fuck me better
It's Cozz, nigga
That's C-O-Z-Z, Mr. Always-Holding-40-OZ
Or a OZ of the OG Kush hash push that ones back, just that, fuck crack
What's that? You don't understand what I'm trying to say?
I'm first place, runner-up about a mile away
How this nigga got side hoes?
And he ain't even got no main
Nigga

'Cause I'm the man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
Niggas scared to get on tracks, 'cause I lays it down
Man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
Niggas scared to get on tracks, 'cause I lays it down
'Cause I'm the motherfucking-
I'm the motherfucking man!

(Yeah, Uh)
Spazzin have some
About to have a asthma attack
Well, half is that
Then the other half is both my hash, in fact
Bumping Acid Rap, I tries to Cadillac
Never understood why cats had to rat
I had the Explorer, I had to trash that shit, never got ass in that
Grade-A grass, homie pass it back
It's a $5 minimum, 3, but you hit it once
Tired of the ignorance, that's why I feel kin to rip
Mass of the innocents, citizen giving kids sweet lines
Cinnamon sedatives interested in women ready to get it in
I ain't stupid, I really do this
I wouldn't fuck with music if I found it useless
Already confident the 40 boost it
I found a flow that can make you lose it
Soulful Ruger put the bullets through ya, lyrically shoot ya
And if I lose it, I'll grab Mama's gun and Erykah Badu ya
Hip-hop's savior, slash, intruder
Niggas act like they knew ya, as soon as your loot up
Nigga got tux, but never do suit up
Smoking weed and acting a fool never really bothered me
I just wish that my moms could see that...

'Cause I'm the man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
Niggas scared to get on tracks, 'Cause I lays it down
Man, you should ask around
I'm the motherfucking man, you should ask around
Niggas scared to get on tracks, 'cause I lays it down
'Cause I'm the motherfucking-
I'm the motherfucking man!

Ask around
Motherfucking man, nigga ask around
It's the motherfucking man, nigga ask around
Holla at your nigga, man I'll be in town
Motherfucking man, nigga ask around
Ha, yeah
Ask around﻿Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA, in that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain
Listen...
﻿He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can't spit?,
Bitch I'll smack your dumb ass (Fayettenam what up? Carolina what up?)
Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)

Dumb ass niggas

City on my back, I just lift my wings, I'm fly
You niggas on my dick, while I

No, my hand game like fucking PSP!
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it's cuming soon,
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting,
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting,
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest In Peace, ya'll boys living too fast,
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash,
Ville niggas don't play,
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won't spray?
Mid-day when it's sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some more new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run

Ha ha ah
I'm the man, hahaha, yea hey
I'm the man
I'm the man, (I told ya'll niggas),
I'm the man

Yea, uh
They say I act like I'm the man, cause motherfucka I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams,
Damn boy I am so flamboyant with the ensemble.
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo,
And I'm the man, now understand a nigga bossin, ' (yea)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it's costing (yea)
Long term plans for the fam, we'll be dropping?
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless I'm flossing (woo)
In the streets niggas peace war until you force him,
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss 'em.
Got damn you niggas got handled,
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled,
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on.
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for 'em
I know who did it, but you think I'm finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him,
That's word, nigga observe my genius.
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning,
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)
I told y'all I'm the man, what the fuck ya'll niggas thinking?

Yea, Yeah
I'm the man
I'm the man nigga
And I'm the man
I'm the man nigga
(I'm the man)

Yea
First and foremost, Fayettenam what's good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Winston Salem,
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga
Everywhere dog, I'm repping from long distance, man.
I told y'all boy, I'm bout to get this money and come home right quick,
Y'all niggas still see me tho, you think I'm still there; you ain't even know I'm gone
Back so much, nigga,
I hear you all little niggas talking, nigga.
Prince of the city, nigga.
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me.
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch.I need that
That pussy I need that
That good weed

Nigga I need that, I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that

[Cozz:]
You bitches
You ain't shit, I swear you think you poppin'
Cause you instagram famous
This ain't the fuckin' same kid
You was fucking with me
I sat back didn't say shit
Now I done lost my patience, ugh
Well if you ask me how I'm livin' I'm just livin' life
From South Central to the waters where these kids reside
I'm a South Central LA nigga just a different type
Went to MiraCosta so the homies think I'm getting white
Hit the beach at day
Then I'm back at 65th at night
Bitch I ain't complaining I just really have to shed some light
Still leave the crib and make sure I don't forget the knife
The Knife got me feeling like I'm superman
But praying I don't run into a crip tonight
That orange nike sign looking red in a different light
Niggas rather kill than fight
Familiar faces drown me but that attitude swi-switch at times
Ha, 'lotta pain 'lotta funerals here
I'm still standing like I just lost in musical chairs
Praying that my cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup
Fill to the brim, brim, brim, brim, brim, brim
I need that

I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that

Yo' feed back, don't need that

Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that

[Bas:]
My team stacked your feedback, don't need that
My crew rollin' and see hoes at each show
Scream I love, don't know them
All facts, you tall tales, you got shells, you don't load 'em
Claim parts that bang hard they don't know you
I just had hopes and bars, now its Nova Scotia corporate cards
Friendly hoes and open bars
Make a wish girl, hold a star
The joke is off, play the game and know your cards
I hope that you came to show 'em off
Don't be ashamed to show 'em off
Let's play the game below the bra
Bitch, don't be ashamed to show 'em off
But hold your heart, I'ma do it 'til we runnin' the game
Top floor in the Bay and fuck it
When I overdone it I never done it in vain
Do it for my niggas 'cause we one and the same
We just rented a house for a week, I need that shit forever and ever
If I got it, I wonder, whatever would happen to me
Cause I just keep meetin' new people
That I can't remember and wonder "How did we happen to meet?"
I used to think niggas like that was assholes
And now I'm like "How did that happen to me?"
Strapped to the seat, I'm killin' the crash course
Eyes on the road, eyes on the road but never the dashboard
If I want to know, If I want to know your opinion I'd ask for it nigga
My team stacked, your feedback, don't need that
My crew rode, and see hoes at each show
Scream I love you don't know them
All facts, you tall tales, you got shells, you don't load 'em
Claim parts that bang hard they don't know you

[Cozz:]
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that
﻿If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

[Hook - Bilal:]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
﻿[J. Cole]
Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
Its only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So i threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

[Drake]
Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work,
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it
Yeah, when lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if..

[Chorus - Drake]

[J. Cole]
Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldnt judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cooking nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, thats just a warning

[Chorus]﻿Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence (no more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
He sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Punk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
Ball dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Part of me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
The good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some
Where is the love?

When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away


Give me rings, give me chains mayne
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a
G5, clear port, say hello to the man
Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people would kill for
Manhattan at 40/40, no forties but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me, and that's love

When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

Now everybody smoke to it
for this is, the celebration

﻿[Verse 1:]
Art of seduction
Hoes jump like vince carter backstage like they apart of production
We talked about her dreams you gotta start out with somethin'
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny cause now they daughter is stuck-in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin on
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?

[Bridge:]
I'll take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mindplay [?]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, How could you not taste it?

[Verse 2:]
That's a little egotistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G though,
Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know, hot bitch fell in my lap like cappucino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though,
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit,
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, now you'd be famous and rich,
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,
She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking bout all the things she can get,
She thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, and it's not that simple cause,
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs... Aye

[Bridge:]
I'll take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mindplay [?]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, How could you not taste it?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah

The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas sun
Yeah I said 'sun'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)
January 28th

Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
(Sound of baby laughing)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars of a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune﻿That was the warm (that was the warm up baby)
Aiight, Elite for real. One tape and I'm up out of here
One, yup, yea
Lord please forgive me for my sinning, I ain't saying that I'm finished but I'm praying in advance
Cause they way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yea ball game-I swear the hoes wasn't in my plans
When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like, bobby had Whitney we were cooking up crack!
But them 15 credits had a nigga off track
Picture that! The best rapper since lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his Bachelors
Remasterd this rap shit you hear the words coming from my lips, bastards
I never crack, I got that chapstick
I practiced til that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now wheres the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or climb, I choosed the ladder
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
Before you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that, No soprano
Half Black, half white I'm a piano
I'm an animal my video on discovery channel
I'm a beast when my shit hits the streets these niggas seize to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami you'll find me in The Ville in the state of NC
Bitch if I ain't back home I'm up in N-Y-C bout that money probably
Like a fucking robbery but I ain't Jacking
I'm chasing dreams sort of like jeans
Boy I ain't slacking, I'm chasing dreams sort of like Jeans boy I ain't slacking
Ay take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking on my shit
I'm strait smacking niggas strait tagging niggas
Yo I'm freestylin fuck ya'll niggas ya'll be wilding and I'm OUT!﻿[Intro:]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Bridge:]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook:]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball
And it breaks my heart
The world's a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2:]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rose, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin serious Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life & Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged I'll just play my part

[Hook]

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once
I got the herb from the blunt
I get the skirt when I want
I get the skirt when I want
Due to the money aroma
My girl she got a diploma
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
The only advice, the only advice for you

Slip me a xanny at once
I got the herb from the blunt
I get the skirt when I want
I get the skirt when I want
Due to the money aroma
My girl she got a diploma
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mac, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

They tell me what's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
﻿[Verse 1]
Momma I just killed a man
My body still trembling can you feel my hand
Don't shed no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma
This may be the last time you see me free ma
Don't spend it cryin'
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skip a class, fluncking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder 'bout my father
Would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas killed for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga momma
But what's done is done
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer

Yeh, now I'm a killer
Guess I'm a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah I mean the killers

[Verse 2]
I wonder whats in store for me
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me
Than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot
Work on the john shot
Who woulda thought I used to block this niggas lay ups
Now he's in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain
And so that I react slow, in this fast world
Slow niggas, fast girls
Hoes give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on 'em
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign
It's deep, all these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I'd rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer

Yeah, into a killer
Don't make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day
Swore that we would make the league, be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit
Watch how they pile up
Seem like a mile up
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend
Skating ring is where we headed tonight
And if a nigga disrespect, yes we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seemed petty
At the time, the shit was heavy
Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas go they brains blown out
Snatched a nigga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries
Another body in a cemetary
Another young nigga in the penetentiary
And he don't give a fuck no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture nigga pictionary
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary
I knew a nigga that threw his dick in every chick in every city that he went to
Went hard like the rent do
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I'm a killer
﻿I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
What the fuck happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?

Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat mouth mammy fucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king

Bitch where was you when I was walkin'-
[POP]
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
[POP]
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
﻿Yea, we fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, huh,
Sometimes play the villan, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be dealer sometimes I be primo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim a round like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, 
Inflat up and make these old niggas open the gate up at the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text let's chill-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby and I got a chic who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Rawley that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, 
Had a nigga feeling like the milkman deliver that due to body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate could'ntkick,
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up!

Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Mmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga jamnastics

Gone with the tide

Bend your ass over bitch 
I'm here for a reason
Cole breezin, flow freezin
This ain't spittin ho - I'm sneezin

Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them loes dos is what I throw peas in

Niggas see me in the street, they talkin bout The Come Up
Or talk about The Warm Up

Jealousy holding enemies hostage
Eventually the penalty will come and haunt ya
Hennessy memories leaving me nauseous
But the Hennessy makes the melodies awesome
So instead of me talking I'm steady jotting
And steady plotting on how to gain spaghetti toppings
You know that parmesan, that cheddar, mozzarella
The list goes on and on you know my heart is strong
I'm a young phenomenon
It's like these people keep forgetting
It's always the least expected who ends up getting it
So don't tell me bout no niggas hating
What's the point if I hear
Mr. not giving a fuck with a joint in his ear
Put that steak on his plate then so long disappear
Empty gut I'm hungry man, the guns pointing this year

I can't lie to you, to tell the truth
I just wanna lie with you
If that's fine with you
I don't wanna spend no time in school
It's a waste of time
And you can't always do what your parents like all the time
Plus, I got enough degrees anyway

Fuck getting signed, boy we probably start a label
Fuck getting mine boy I'm tryna feed the table
Fuck being fine girl you gotta have a brain too
You gotta have a brain too cus

[J. Cole:]
Death to the imposters, label me the king
My dreams could win Oscars, my niggas turned mobsters
My white friends doctors, fatherless child
Listen how I got this knowledge is wild
Streets taught me, speak softly nigga watch from the crowd
Cause any nigga that's loud, just want attention and eventually blaow
No fake niggas allowed in my circle dawg
You been through half the shit I been through it'll hurt ya dawg
Tread softly, my nigga moving state to state running late watch 'em
Tryna avoid state troopers, that's the weight watchers
Run this dope set this cake till they say "Gotcha"
Or till the fat lady sings, and niggas hate operas
And Oprah hate niggas
Make no mistake that we know the stake still, we hope to make over eight figures
Slim chances, but niggas bet against the odds and who am I to criticise how you play your cards dawg

Cause I done beat the odds going way too hard
I been getting slept on for way too long
I been patiently waiting for way too long
I been quiet dawg for way too long
You can't knock the hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong
I said you can't knock my hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong

Look, I never admit it, tryna get my brother acquitted
Yo' tell the judge I be happy to pay him off if he's with it
My flesh and blood, hauled off to the cell
I search for heaven as I see him getting lost in this hell
Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming "Fuck a cop"
Guess he took it serious, for me that shit was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame
Decisions, decisions, the Porsche or the Range
I take a trip back to the 'Ville only corpses remain
Some of them niggas still breathing but they dead inside
Victims of a genocide
Tears fill my eyes dawg

Cause I've been out of touch man for way too long
I've been out in Hollywood for way too long
I've been, getting this paper for way too long
I ain't called my pops back in way too long
I done make my girl wait for way too long
I wonder if I changed, am I way too on?
Can't knock my hustle but It's way too strong
It's way too strong

How much you worth? How big is your home?

I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit

Don't give no fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give no fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily
Sipped so much Actavis, I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby

Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lacksiyal daisy

He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "Where have you done lately?"

Yea, ay, look

Probably cause she so fine it will blow your mind she black and Pocahontas
Laid back and blow that grind

That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, "Oh girl that boy the bomb!
No chain around his neck but better watch out for the charm
Your not my daughter um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

If it's clean I'll lick you up!
Yea do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my tee shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on come up on his ski jet
You scared of that water of you just scared to get your weave wet
Barely got your feet wet
Guess I know where we headed
Tryna see throw it back let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for!
You can be my cuddy buddy - baby what are friends for
I spend up the tempo them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nothing younger than the 80s I'm grown and I'm looking for some Ladies

[Chorus:]
Ay with your fat ass booty and your curly ass weave!
Yea, I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeves
Ay now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood
(Ladies, beautiful Ladies, ohh Ladies, all of you ladies)﻿[Verse 1:]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past like
"Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, should've asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "Be cool with me" shit
I bagged two bitches like it's two of me bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother's room
Like man I might as well be sleeping in my mother's room
Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all this old gear
This is flow here, this is no fair
This is so pure, this is so clear
This is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding and I do the most here
I'm the President you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here
Nigga I coast here
That's why they got me set up on this West Coast here
Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man I been thinkin' bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city in New York nine years
Ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Hook:]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Verse 2:]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
Cause you already know who your genie is
Can't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn he turned out to be a genius
Damn real shit nigga no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes, boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off
Damn now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"

[Hook:]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Verse 3:]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting, now she staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with﻿[Intro:]
Yea, warm up!
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa

[Verse 1:]
Yea, ay yea Fayettenam
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, it's the Fayettenam hey
Hey and your glasses and your glasses and your glasses
To the sky is, yea this is the last call for alcohol
This is the Warm Up
Yea, look now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up!
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Chorus:]
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, it's the Fayettenam hey
Hey and your glasses and your glasses and your glasses
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm up!
So get cha back up off the wall

[Verse 2:]
Yea, now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up! -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up,
at least give the nigga commonsense to wrap his dick up
Toast the spliff up, our glasses then sip up,
We fly past they look up
They don't last we give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yea these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My office is forreal ah fuck sack, niggas getting coffin in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York Niggas fuck with me I got em singing Ville songs
I guess it's only right cause we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Times for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea,
In NY but smile everytime I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that! You who that?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel to the reps blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fuckig city that's just sitting on me
But yea it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starring and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga who used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting them just to put the Ville on the map
Now I am
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, Mr. Fayettenam hey
Hey and raise your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky and...
This is the last call for alcohol

[Talking:]
﻿We on Ali? You ugly
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Chorus]
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
but I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes

[Chorus]

And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed man
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh

[Chorus]

Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, boy that don't sound like you
I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

[Chorus]

[uncredited female]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all I could say is, will the radio care?
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focussed, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word

[uncredited female]
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
﻿Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label - are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm a shame, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open up doors
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars, and so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school, he's getting by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out and blaze with me
2 in the morning and we still high assed out
Screaming "thug till I die" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While trying to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed
Cause life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word is hell
Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's getting old
Plus with the drama we're looking out for your baby's mama
Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gaming on dumb hotties at yo' parties
Me and you, no truer two
While scheming on hits
And getting tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!

[Hook]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Verse]
Bury me smiling with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way before kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride
Until I get free, I live my life in the fast lane
Got police chasing me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers, miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn?
Life goes on

[Hook]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?

Life goes on homie
Gone on, cause they passed away
Niggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga
They're gonna be like, "Goddamn, them niggas came up"
That's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man
Don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more hold me no more
Yes it do yes it do yes it do﻿Uh
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse One]
I had this little bad thing somethin' like them 10's
She gave a nigga mad brain somethin' like the wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her
About the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin' you feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause
She be healin' that shit
And nah that ain't your girl dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the mean time it's lights please

[Hook]
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright
Lights please

[Verse Two]
So now we in the hotel
Mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's
I hear her and I'm willin'
But everytime I smoke well a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke well I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they'd love to see us all go to prison or die
Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it she workin' jerkin' it non stop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin' the more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make
Coward nigga you a fake
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay
Rubbed my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world
But for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please

[Hook]
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright
Lights please

[Outro]
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Turn off the lights
Lights Please
Yeah
That's it﻿[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
‘Ey to you it don’t matter cause you still gon’ ride with me
You’re still gon’ ride wit’ me
I say you’re still gon’ ride wit’ me
I know you’re still gon’ ride wit’ me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a, nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I’m a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I’m fly, I’m a right brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that couldn’t ever worry ’bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorised her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I’m coming to arrest her
Yah, y’all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don’t be a parr man, that nigga was a dog
So it’s me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do they make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
‘Ey Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
‘Ey to you it don’t matter cause you still gon’ ride wit’ me
You’re still gon’ ride wit’ me
I say you’re still gon’ ride with me
I know you’re still gon’ ride with me, hey
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon’ do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
‘Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it’s time to hit the real World filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain’t nobody calling you back
You say it’s cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the World on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
‘Ey has this World got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had to break on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it’s just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain’t changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you’ll get the same me

[Hook]

‘Ey baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
‘Ey to you it don’t matter cause you still gon’ ride with me
You’re still gon’ ride with me
I say you’re still gon’ ride with me
I know you’re still gon’ ride with me, hey

Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon’ do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
‘Ey maybe we can live

Just like a star that’s in my sky
Just like an Angel on my pain
You have appeared to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it’s been, way too long
Can’t find the words to write this song
Hey, Ugh, still I wanna worry
But it ain’t what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin’ out my mind
Man

[Hook]

‘Ey baby girl, roll down the window

﻿Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in

Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh,
Nothing but sweat, tears,
Just another perspective,
Yeah

Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius,
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans,
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play with killers hung yack and slung crack for leisure,
And tell a nigga run that and gun clap for sneakers,
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers,
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers,
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Where my trust at?
No time to think about illegal when my stomachs touching,
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busted,
I see the world for what it is now,
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now,
Cause, uh, it was a set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes,
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck,
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky,
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby,
Hope that it gets better baby,
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw,
Don't let them break you, (you)

Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto birds circulate,
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursin them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We all young, black, some strapped,
Them whites had they lunch pack for school, we had our guns stacked.
And all a nigga wanna do is take his mother from that,
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back.
To kill a nigga over beef and cheddar is even better,
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest.
Fuck a crooked cop three times,
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine,
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time.
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas steal purse and 'em,
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!

The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky,
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby,
Hope that it get better baby,
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw,
Don't let them break you, (you)
[Verse 1 - Bas:]
Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary
Fiend

[Hook:]
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?
That's a half?
Shit it was
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?

[Verse 2 - Bas:]
She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape? ", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo Finish and Fornication
Photo Finish and Fornication
Fiend

[Hook:]
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?
That's a half?
Shit it was
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?

[Bridge 1 - KQuick:]
Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug?
What's your drug?

[Bridge 2 - J. Cole:]
Take it all the way from the beginning.
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that let's people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...

[Verse 3 - J. Cole:]
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin', he made it rappin'
Now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'? "It's Lit. Feel the buzz?"
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?, that's deep

[Outro - Bas:]
Feel the buzz?
It's Lit
Feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz?

(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it muthafucker
Yes
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
never let jail turn my shine into Moses
couldn’t cleanse my soul with them civil rights sposes
panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op this priceless, frame our wanted posters

ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the shower posse
Gone!!!

(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it motherfucker

[Kanye West:]
I’m here, it’s the misogyny
bad bitches massaging me
sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
so please don’t judge me, ugh, for the following
fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
take of that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Cruncy
the devil stay testing
’cause when you chase the pussy it’s a sin
but if it falls in your lap it’s a blessing
soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
had used the main leathers (leathers, leathers, leathers)

[Cyhi The Prynce:]
Cyhi, Cyhi, Yeah
boy, we looking for trouble
maybe if we wasn’t black then we wouldn’t have struggled
player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
they cook and I smuggle
got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
so I’m running through them circles,
boy I’m looking like Knuckles
look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog I’m good for a scuffle
don’t be mad I whooped your ass ’cause I’ve tooken a couple
feds asking niggas questions but I wouldn’t rebuttal
‘cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
with a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
ain’t nothing silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
but now I’m eating off of rather yellow gold
exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
but don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
‘cause all my Titos got bricks like a yellow road

[Big Sean:]
GOOD, I do it
B.I.G. Sean Don nigga
(But you found it mutherfucker)

(Boy)
new double-D’s smashed in her blouses
fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
my nigga, we rent houses
so many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
this is showtime, showtime, boy
I hope you set the DVR
stacking money face to face, dish it, look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
so now I’m snapping like yo’ ass just finished a poem
does he sound like ‘Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
meanwhile, I’m chilling with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
a killer before the crime, a BIG before the Dime
greet me wit a middle finger when you see me
it’s cool, ’cause I can’t see yo’ ass from this side of the TV muthafucker

[J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
what you now hear is putting fear in all the older ones
down played me to downgrade me like they don’t notice son
your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
fucking hoes while teaching niggas to hold your sons
this the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
high as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
heard you looking for trouble, what, I’m supposed to run?
yo’ bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I supposed to cum?
got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
now you outside of heaven’s gate, fronting like you know someone
talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
they say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
fuck it, everybody can get it
when you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
but when you’re this high everybody’s a midget
all this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothing
could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
went from quarter to broke to half past rich
with my badass bitch
and you don’t want no problems on some math class shit
so check the young genius out
fuck the World, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
what you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming ’bout
﻿Yea huh
Yea one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one two uh-huh
Yea, uh
Yea uh

Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you,
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them go deep like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance,
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip don't fall,
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance,
Don't lose your balance

I look around at my city this is SinVille
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why the cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it I just had another friend killed
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"-
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you cause you my brother so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but there's bigger better things
And for those that passed I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

Yea and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance,
Don't be losing your balance,
My nigga don't be losing your balance,
Uh yea so don't slip, don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance, uh
Don't lose your balance

I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal I'm a... sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men ah sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' I did the same when I saw that ass
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homiess beefin' cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick will make me switch
But man I can't help it dog her mind got me whipped

I think I'm losing my balance
I think I'm losing my balance yea
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance,
But I won't slip I won't fall,
Just a get a grip and hold on
Losing my balance,
Losing my balance﻿[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can’t imagine what it’s like for you
I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin’ if this is gon make me think bout wifing you
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you
Now I aint tryna pick a fight with you, I’m tryna talk
Now I aint tryna spend the night with you
I’m kinda lost see
I’ve been giving it some thought lately and frankly
I’m feelin’ like we aint ready and it’s… hold up now
Let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself
A nigga barely over 20, where the hell we gon live?
Where am I gon get that money
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I aint got shit to give ‘em
And I’m not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
Girl, you gotta think bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said nigga you got the nerve
To come up to me talkin’ bout abortion
This my body nigga so don’t think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals
It figures though, should’ve known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws
Knowing all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw mothafucker
Now I’m pregnant you don’t wanna get involved muthafucker
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?
I don’t think so
This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I’m your wife
This new life here I’mma love it
I ain't budging, I’ll do this by my muthafucking self
See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man
But I still don’t understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
Bout your father and you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin’ bout he a coward and you so glad that you aint that nigga
Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin’ the same shit
You ain't shit nigga!

[Chorus]
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it
Now, I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she aint no wife though
Uh oh, she tellin’ him she missed her period like typo’s
He panicking, froze up like a mannequin
A life grows inside her now he asking “is it even mine”
What if this bitch aint even pregnant dawg
Could she be lying?
And she be crying cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It’s like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
(What about your seed nigga?)

And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it

[Verse 1 - Bas:]
So what do you do? Your job? Nah
I mean, your passion if you have one
It could pass you, better grab one
And what do they do (who?)
My squad - fiends
Niggas stay on it (on it)
See this nigga roll it (roll it)
Go on and light it
But you gotta pass to me
Besides, my shit get tied up
'Cause I don't really pass three
And I ain't pass it yet
But could ash it, please?
I'm still smoking that shit
You fuckin with Master Chief
But I ain't Halo (Halo)
But I'm okay though (I'm good)
Got food, got a horse in the stable
Got a move, are you able?
But I lose the days, come chicks to play
Play a game of spades
These days is ace of spades
But half these bitches fakes
Zonin but I'm wide alert
Phone in, I gotta buy some work
Oh, got that granddaddy purp
I say "man, that'll work"
Got some OG, I mix em up
This blunt - elevator
If you're up, hello hater
I can't see you, my vision blurred
I love my bitches, all my bitches
It's me and them not his and hers
We be smoking, we be drinkin
We be fuckin, tell her quick
"Would you please stop saying we
'Cause we mean nothing, celibate"
Sure I'm bout it, adamant
I'm straight up nigga, don't you be frontin, let's do it

[Hook x2 - Bas:]
Let's do it there
Or we could do it here
But when we done it's a love souvenir

[Verse 2 - Bas:]
I'm really not that mean
But my thoughts is so cruel
Little nigga, don't you get involved
I'm so ahead of ya'll
It's the year 20-42
I just ball, I'm old school
Bet that bitch fresh right now
I don't step, press right now
What you want me to say to you
Guess I'm impatient so I want sex right now
You won't get face trig, don't be so basic, I just want you here right now
Fiendin, I rep it - Queen to Houston, Texas, London, Essex
I know this ain't my town
But I'm in this bitch right now, fiendin

[Hook x2 - Bas]
﻿Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 1:]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planed out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I'm a keep it honest
I think it's a little ironic
If I hit another chick it's gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And where I wanna be was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can't leave you alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
She know me like a book, it's too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy to please my ass
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass
It's true that, true that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat!, who dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I've been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved you ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick
Trying justify it, thinking man we finna be rich
And some bad bitch I barely know sending me flix

[Chorus]﻿[Intro]
Love yourz
Love yourz
No such thing

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrivedBitch, you so cliché, you like them J's
You like them chains, well that's okay
Cause that's a game that I can play
Only cause you be the baddest
'Scuse me for rudely askin'
How you be passin' your classes if you be absent?
Even the cutest of the stupid students who be havin' them horny ass teachers
Grades be usuallyaverage, you gettin' A's, from the teachers who don't pass kids
Because them titties hypnotizing and that booty magic
Almost caught me up in yo' trap but I know the facts, I'm from Los Angeles
I can not support these cutie's habits
Five hours later, got a tapir, tryna take her to the crib
Hittin' doobies laughin', hop a fence, we in the hotel, in that 'cuzzi splashin'
Promise to take her ass to a movie after, I hope I'm in that coochie tappin'
But she the type who shoes be matchin', the Louis baggage
In this world where bodies and boobies eatin' plastic
For life's beauty pageant, who really got a chance with chicks like this
Man, all the shit I did, 'fore a chance, just let my dick slide in
Man, I really hope that it helps a bit that I'm just a bit light-skinned
But if not fuck it, you can hit me up tomorrow, I bet you get it right then
And if you got some friends, invite them
She light-skinned? Aiight then
Yo white friends? That's coo'
Bring five friends, I got my friends
We got weed, we got brew
So hit me up tomorrow... yup, yup, uh

Woke up early just to hit the blunt, check my phone
See if any squirelly's tryna get the nut, young brown-skinned nigga
Waves but hair pretty curly when it isn't cut
Hair thoroughly keep it brushed but what she really wants is that light-skinned nigga
She really want that light-skinned nigga
She really want a light-skinned nigga
She do it for the light skin nigga, woah

She said she want that light-skinned nigga
And if you comin' bring that right friend with' ya
But don't trip cause you might get richer
Cause you know she got a white friend with' her
Let's go bro, cause we on
I do a 100 all the way home
Gotta get dressed, put my chain on, I swear I'm in my zone
Cause tonight is my night, I might spray a little cologne
Cause tonight, I'ma pipe, cause I've been away too long
Like don't tease me girl, yeah, and I know you want to please me girl, yeah
Okay, I just wanna know what the purpose is, why these niggas say "No [?] "
I just wanna know what the purpose is before I really let you stay
Cause these bitches still on me, they can't stay in they place
If you was wondering what my taste is, just take a look at your face
And I don't know, it's so racist but two light-skins, you safe
If you was wondering who my ace is, he locked up with that case

Woke up early just to hit the blunt, check my phone
See if any squirelly's tryna get the nut, young brown-skinned nigga
Waves but hair pretty curly when it isn't cut
Careful, really keep it brushed but what she really wants is that light-skinned nigga
She really want that light-skinned nigga
She really want a light-skinned nigga
She do it for the light-skin niggas, woah
Woke up early just to hit the blunt, check my phone
See if any squirelly's tryna get the nut, young brown-skinned nigga
Waves but hair pretty curly when it isn't cut
Careful, really keep it brushed but what she really wants is that light-skinned nigga
﻿Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolBoy Q:]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!


[MC Eiht:]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[MC Eiht:]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that ﻿Yeah,
It's me!
Feels good,
Carolina, what up? (Blazing)
Fayettenam, what up?
Therapist.
Yo, ay, Yo!

You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind,
A savage over this cabbage,
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (no)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs,
I'm on my grind, yo,
Bonafide hancho,
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds,
As matter of fact, I'm so bomb- niggas scatter that,
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto,
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know.
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick,
Survival's a bitch!
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo,
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-4.
God knows I don't put up no facade, no,
No fraud, niggas scheming like Side-Show Bob,
Keep my eyes so wide, not another wise,
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh,
From the other side, punk-ass nigga.
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk,
Blast pop while I pump gas,
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath,
My niggas will ride all day like a funpass,
That's some New York shit,
I'm from the south, though,
Don't never disrespect me, watch yo' mouth hoe,
I got agent clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful.
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro!﻿Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
I'll, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'm a pass your classes, I'm a learn your craft
I'm a fuck your daughters, I'm a burn your flag

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit

Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio
Dike niggas actin' like a bunch of women scorned
Haters form like ice after winter storms
Never play along, bag a chick, girl let's make a porn
Make a sandwich bitch, make a marriage, strip, go south like you on a van with
Split like the grams me and my man get, gotta feed the fam, understand this
8 balls, underhand pitch, snitch crawl, under sand ditch
Paint a perfect picture would you be my canvas? my name is in the scripture my makin' to plan this
I panoramic panned it, [?] it, 8 cylinder like [?], like ten chick, outstanding
I planned it, outstanding, good things come to those who wait
But hey, I want that cake right now, take a bitch on a sober date
What I look like? hit the gate, and board a flight cloud it formed
You are now in the right crowd when you hear that weak shit, tell them niggas pipe down
Fiend bitch, get her beak wet, mirror wipe down
She show me the secrets, she'll show you the night gown, [?] life clown
Dumb dumb sit yo ass down, that's game
Like Drake bitch thank me later, New York yankee, fuck you, hater
Big crib, mad trees, don't see my neighbor, just see that paper
Yeah she's a stand up chick but shit, I layed her, I layed her, yeah she's a stand up chick, but shit, I layed her, I layed her
Yeah she's a stand up chick, but shit, I layed her, I layed her, Fiend Bitch
﻿Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
That sloppy

This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black (Pendleton) ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

[Hook:]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home

[Hook]

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is
﻿Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on

Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

You looking like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
(we at the school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational

Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish

That Louies Burger never be the same
(won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin'

Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

[Anna Wise 2x:]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way

[Jay Rock:]
Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings,
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping,
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga,
I just hope the Lord forgive him

Pots with cocaine residue,
Every day I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eat cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em,
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch

Drop that work up in the bushes,
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth,
This the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas
Selling drugs but it's all good

Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[K's Mom:] Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.
Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a motherfucker.
Shit, I'm tryna get my thing going, too. Just bring my car back.
Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him!

[K's Dad:] Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass.

[K's Mom:] See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain't even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
[Intro:]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted, blasted
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Can you dig)

[Break:]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

[Verse 1 - Bas:]
Pass it, pass it, now I'm blasted
Ash it, ash it stupid bastard
My eyes lower than a casket
My piff greener than the Packers
Or the JETS
My chicks meaner then the ratchet
Bet my [?] seedless
My hydro, I call it drastic
That's that shit, have a nigga on a trip
Get a grip, counter grip
Grab a bitch, pound a bitch
Hittin' licks, pounds of piff
I don't ever feel these rapper I can tell they counterfeit
Hop up on the mountain pits

[Hook - 66 Holds:]
And them hoes they know
The feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

[Break]

[Verse 2 - Bas:]
Mooking haze everyday, face
Slid up on a base, safe
Sorry copper, I don't take the bait, snake
I just move the weight, cake
While I'm out of state, I go on a date
Then I will penetrate, I don't make mistakes
Feel I'm 'bout to break, I let her decide my fate
She treat me like a shake, wait, wait
Count money burn celebratory blunts
Gotta get it cause you only gonna live it once
Tryna own it, I ain't fuckin' with the rented ones
Jamaica Queens, but I take it where it's really from
The sentence of the kush, ascended from the kush
All you mook hoes, do a bear shit in the woods

[Hook]

[Break]

[Verse 3 x2 - Bas:]
They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a 46 nigga feel 16
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man, like a rich man

I'm super mook

[Hook]
[Bas:]
Smokin that good
No Reggie, No Theus
My niggas the G'est
Don't shit come between us
No money, No hoes
Don't shit come between us
How we play dirty but step out the cleanest?
G shit bitch learn the meaning
From here to Medina, I bag all the model chics
Call em Athena, cause they are some Godesses
My politics don't got no policies just livin life everyday no apologies
Apologies for the delay I was up in the stars rollin up on astrology
Economies in disarray but a couple mixtapes gon put me in ecology
Ecology?
Ecology, that's green nigga
Global Warming, that's me nigga
Heatin up, They ain't keepin up
Had a taste, I ain't eat enough
Hoes fast like they let a whole day pass without eatin none
If the 44's rung, Hemdi's the one
If them hoes open, I'll leave with them
One

[Hook x2:]
You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am!
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am!
You'll never be higher than I am! (so high)
You'll never be higher than I am! (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am! (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am! (I'm Mooked)

I'm Super Mooked

[Hemdi:]
Should I tell my story?
Or should I show my scars?
This is Hemdi & Bas, this is avant garde
Niggas swear they smart, till they ass get snatched thru the fog
I got a couple bitches think they slick, but far from espionage
Me and 3 bitches, that's just a collage
I'm an artist of a rare kind, you just a facade
The quiet sun, metamorphosis, I have just evolved
My horizon bright and I box thru life like Cus was involved
Muhammad Ali, the Iron Mike-ness
If I lay somethin down it's war time nigga no women no kids that kill is righteous
Got blood on my glasses, give me a second to wipe it
Let's proceed when it touch white folks I guess that's when it becomes a crisis
But we still in the ghetto, where we chase money and hoes
The OG's say " Thank YOU, Young fella. I guess nobody had the courage to write this"
And we drive foreign cars, But the evil drives us
And we ride on each other so easy
Cause the demons ride us

[Hook x2:]
You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am!
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am!
You'll never be higher than I am! (so high)
You'll never be higher than I am! (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am! (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am! (I'm Mooked)

I'm Super Mooked﻿
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga"

Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it
Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's
something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I
finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?

[2Pac:]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Right

[2Pac:]
That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see - and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich
people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm
saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you
know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha, they might eat the rich

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight
so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

[2Pac:]
I
see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of
the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where
I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made
myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time
to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions
for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now
I make millions for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

[2Pac:]
By
my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in "all good
things come to those that stay true." You know what I'm saying, and it
was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was
noticing, shit, I was
punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you
know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna
go straight through

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

[2Pac:]
Shit,
I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened
with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it
goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to
fight back

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight well, how long you think it
take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I
can't win and I wanna lay it all down

[2Pac:]
In this country a
black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and
that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause
once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man,
out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud
mouth 30-year old muthafuckas

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's crazy,
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I
can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

[2Pac:]
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I don't think America
know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be
some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be
murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's
crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of
energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

[2Pac:]
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."

What's your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac?
Pac?!


You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dali Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!

Used to like bitches with hair permed

﻿[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side﻿[Chorus]
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothing but time
One day you’re gonna set me free
But first you gotta let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look momma I’m flyin’

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I’ll never never land

[Verse 1]
Check my fortune cookie, its that Cole World
Could that mean it’s meant to be?
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur
This life is fucking with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me
My bad girl sayin’ fuck all that, enter me
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them muthafuckas sign off
I got the on my dick they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)
I don’t know whats worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’m sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever
I gotta make it to the top, it’s either now or never
These other niggas can’t adapt because they not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt its better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And, so sick they can’t fix this with medi-cine
We at yo door and she gotta let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya’ll already already

[Chorus]

﻿[Verse 1:]
Uh, angel eyes, long hair
I see you cryin', what's wrong there
He did what? He fucked who?
We know the story, what's new?
See I could probably, rush you
Tell you that he should have loved you
Take advantage, fuck you
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same
On different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score
You got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers
Pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off
You bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode
Why we cheat? I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know
That he cheated, and somehow I never told
I never told

"Hey, you wanna be a man?
Yeah I wanna be a man.
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.
I ain't gonna tell.
Alright then man. You're a man now.
Okay."

[Verse 2:]
OK, that's what it is, I see the game
The hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The old G's that beat the game
Forever young, Peter Pan
35, still playin', child support, still payin'
Jugglin', bill payin'
Been runnin' round, field dayin'
Wine and dine, meal payin'
With hopes that she'll land
The bed and, get wet then, give head then
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man
One night stands, no best man
No bridesmaids, or reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts
There go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark
Just to have that shit torn apart

"You know what? I need to talk to you.
About what?
I don't think this is, working out for us.
Why?
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.
What the fuck?!"

New York Times
Come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I watch it all, pain out, trying not to stand out
Fish out of water, unofficial reporter
Appear, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city with niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened not once
My nigga visibally stressed in a mess he's smoking a blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that
All I do is pray for that
This is city God told me, go and make it at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

Same places, different faces on the train, man
New York, New York

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick
That's how success came
Once kings, now we pawns in this chess game
Wall Street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach, I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking 'bout how
My motive: to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared of night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We gon' make it primetime till we dyin'

[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefa and plates
To eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly immigrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart, nigga
Bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart

Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge:]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came on home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook:]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2:]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpackin', that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge: x2]
I must confess, I copped the chains

This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killing niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue about the same thing
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing?
Well

[Missy Elliott:]
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey

He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name

[J. Cole:]
Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby where your roommates, did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories about different dudes
Her man on campus but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like 4-5 niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by 3

[Missy Elliott:]
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey

I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, nameMy adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggas I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick 
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, vicious telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

[Interpretation of Method Man's "Bring the Pain":]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight
And fuck your boyfriend bitch, I want some ass tonight You know my steelo, Alize and Cristal, weed
Sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the, cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down clutchin' they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me?, laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin' no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (yeah nigga, no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (what, what nigga)
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (no pain nigga)
Let's go inside my astral plane (no pain)

Bury me that's what they all say
It's time to make a killin', sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say?, now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin' it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, Baptize the public
Now you all thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas'll bleed, fuckin' with me you'll be deceased
Never restin' in peace, nigga
With no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane

[Collision:]
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggas, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain

Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's DeVante droppin' that beat like that BEYATCH
In case you wonderin'
And jealous niggas, hahaha, see y'all niggas
Motherfuckin' niggas are shit

Westsiiiiiide! Death to everybody that ain't down with me
That's on, feel me? Hahaha
Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know who you are, it's still Bad Boy Killa

Fat motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfuckers
Weak ass niggas, dancers turned fuckin' CEOs
Put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse
Feel me nigga, haha
No more pain
Hey DeVante I'm givin' these motherfuckers choices
Niggas can roll with us, or they can be rolled up under us
That's on you nigga, what you wanna do?
Last year we was lettin' these niggas kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiide!﻿[Hook:]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old is forever
Something that's old is forever
Love
Love
Love
Love

Love
Love
Love
Love﻿Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain't no mystery why there picking me for
I've been hot since '97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I'm skinny, didn't eat so I'm hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it's funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn't get on
One time for my city bitch I'm putting it on
Like a condom when I'm with your girl, ballin' like it's intramural
Back in school, hoopin' to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminsce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn't nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn't make it past flirting
Now I'm taking baths with there naked ass jerkin
Make It Last forever playing in the background
You can that as whatever I was laying that down
She gon hat emy ass forever, I ain't gon bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them texted spillin on your dresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast'es
I never disrespected, I'm clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don't wanna fuck him, now they wanna fuckin' like him
And hope you fuckin' wife him

Yeah, nuttin' like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin' jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can't impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh, apparently some of y'all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don't care to see
Don't make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your favourite rapper embarrassed, see
I'm the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don't wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I'm dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y'all gotta share me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me
Yeah, yeh﻿[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge 1: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Hook:]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'm a show you how to make it all work
Another plan, it a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Bridge 2: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Hook:]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Bridge 3: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Hook: x2]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes of my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama diallin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work it the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know
Why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals"
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of running

Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

[2Pac:]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Flatline]

[2Pac:]
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss 
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
"Black Power!" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me

[2Pac:]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

[Rappin' 4-Tay:]
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down
That's when I'll be around
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

[2Pac:]
Guess you figure you know me, 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club drink and buzzed
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now

[2Pac (Rappin 4-Tay):]
(Only God, mane)
That right?
(That's real)
Hahahahahaha
(Fuck everybody else, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That's for the homie mental
(Hehehehe)
We up out
﻿Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
Well alright

[Chorus x2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
Where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga!
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry

[Chorus x2]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
Capital One popping up on my caller I.D.
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it
See I know, when the harsh reality takes toll
Open up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy? ")

[Chorus x2]

[Ab-Soul:]
Welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck
Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh'
I feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!)
My sky's gray, my bitch is brighter
Always saying "Lights Please", J. Cole's her ghostwriter
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything's subject to change like broken dollars
I'm a, drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina
Like a Pirahna fin, it gets harder than Rihanna whenFell in love through a photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like, two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find

Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my healthPicture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin'
"Know there's dope being sold", but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin' and my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'
Picture me rollin'

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?)

[Big Syke:]
I got ki's comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
in front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine
Picture me rollin'

[Danny Boy:]
Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'

[CPO (2Pac):]

Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots. So what?
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac
(We caught 'em sleepin', he didn't peep you niggas creepin'?)
(This how we do it every weekend)
(I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit)
(CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it)
(I get the liquor, and you could get the females)
(This crooked shit that we inflictin' gettin' street sales)
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9

Can the hoe see me from here?
Can you see me, hoe?
Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police, can you see me?
Am I clear to you? 
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Bogart, Mopreme
It's sad dog, can you picture us rollin'?
Can you see me hoe?
Is y'all ready for me?
We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'[Verse 1:]
I'm lookin at my receipt like goddamn it, that's my receipt
She do it with no hands but damn it she wide recieve
Super Mookin fiends, bitch, we the new elite
Locally, overseas, bitch so well received
This is life like, 3 strikes of felonies
3 times ahead of niggas, don't know a better nigga
I need a sweater with some SMF lettering
A tour with 30 busses that my niggas go hammer in
And we could through all the litigation, we ain't settling
Calin' all the pots black, but we ain't kettling
Standing at the door, won't you let us in
Kick it down, going places we ain't never been
We tryna find a torch, we just laugh at your misfortune
Staring out the window 'cause this life is in full motion
Make a movie out the b roll, that action keep you focused
Fuck your token of appreciate, I need payment
Nothing say thanks like a whole bunch of O's
And some pretty little hoes when anything goes and
I'm a shoot my shot if she open
I said I'm a shoot my shot if she open

[Verse 2:]
Uh, I've been lookin at you all damn night
You the cookie I've been lookin for my whole damn life
Bitches early, this a long ass night
Shorty bustin and suckin and all that right, yea
She on that white all last night
Did it off me, man she skied my pipe
That pedico make her need that diaper
Shittin on the game, bitch I need that diaper

[Verse 3:]
I'm afflicted, sick like flu though
I'm the future like Pluto
All my niggas like kudos
All my bitches got kulo
You can grab it and have it
Never thirsty, I'm cool ho, she let me thrash it like pool hoes
Up that bat with a 2-0, elementary mathematics
I need at least 2 hoes and give me at least 2 O's
That's 56 or 57 pending on your connect and how much that nigga respect it
Could check it to a fiend
It's more than a gram, you understand?
Ain't enough snow in the sand, you understand?
Bitch don't jump in the lake, it's all sharks
My nigga, it's money to be made, I want parts

[Verse 4:]
I'm hard on hoes, call me the critic
My nigga call me up like Bas they all could get it
But them bitches is beat, them hoes was hit
Damn, the weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
﻿God help the hungry children
Help the homeless children
Help them to survive a World they can’t understand

God help the child who’s needy
Who deserves not pity
Help them to survive this cold and bitter land

Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is the Ville, home of the fast-lifers
Where we get high and don’t come down, we gas righteous
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was
Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars
I ain’t crying tho..
Then save that pity for the next man
Or that girl getting beat down by her ex-man
Hey, hold your head, mama
I know you wish that nigga dead, mama
If I can find a way to kill him, I won’t have any drama
Damn mama, tell me who you love
This one is for the boy that sees his mama on drugs
I feel your pain, boy and just know that I been through the same, boy
That lady needs you more than ever
Don’t be ashamed boy
Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella
And now she in the bedroom on her knees
Staring at the sky, screaming “Lord please!”
Tell me now

[Hook - J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

[Verse 2]
Soon as you cling on, my mind’s saying “be gone!”
I leave em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons
Confused, cause friendship’s abuse and I’m sorry for it
My life performance been trifling, some nights I fight my conscience?
Was never given space, but I always heared the heart
Always miss playing the hand that was dealt the joker cards
It’s what I was feeling like, lonely low energy
Fallin slow clinically, ballin’ over we finna be
Don’t pity me ever, even when them haters answering
Mindstate of the victim, no victim, I’m just a champion
Money come in slow, God, intervene
Spirit’s never broken, I’m just focused, don’t pity me
No no no, you see this pain put a strain on my whole life
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights
But all I ask is don’t pity me, no, no!
Don’t pity me, no, no, no!

[Hook]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

I can’t cry about it
Nah, nah, be strong
Can’t cry about it
Hey

[Verse 3]
I freestyle life, can barely write the rent
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check
Call up mama, hate to borrow money, with Christmas near
Hey you know what? How about we make each other gifts this year
Friends are calling me up, asking me if I’m signed yet
Who I’m working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?
Disappointment within their voices, do they pity me?
Disbelief, I’ma stay driven like them city streets
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather
Can barely fit my pain and poverty the same umbrella
But he don’t care, he don’t care, it’s hard to keep em dry
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom
This life’ll flash before your eyes
So get your match before your fire turns to ash
No more drive, no more gas, before you cry, get your last
Before you die, life your past with no regrets
Broken X, no looking back man

[Hook]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it

Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
Yeah
﻿I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2 - Drake:]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 3 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, OK? You gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker homie" ﻿[J. Cole:]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[J. Cole:]
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song "Dreams" for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd, Totally Krossed Out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me

[J. Cole:]
Well this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like "Give me 20 dollars, dollars."
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me

[J. Cole:]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[Verse 1:]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the Fly
I'm touchin' skies, no puffin' lie
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Gon' finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
From a Civic to a Chevy must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11 - please go find a reverend
You see I promise that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga - Othello
I'm ballin' with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmello
Now the crib got much room -Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit yo ass down like you was playin' a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a head band

[Chorus:]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2:]
I'm a kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm givin' out life sentences
Like keep grindin' boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I pay dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creepin' out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth it what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feelin' him
You gotta adapt though never goin' back

[Chorus:]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back today
But if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all dem people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me﻿Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man,
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do,
Real Quick,
Uh.

You know what they say,
The window to the soul is in the eyes,
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blind,
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the super soakers,
I got 'em so wet, fuck that, more wet,
I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking,
Nervous? nigga, please.
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, it's like a nigga be baking.
Walk that's so cold, this shit will need blankets,
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient.
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones,
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones.
Hit and run, bigger funds,
But still can't forget to pour liquor,
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come.
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny,
So I do what's best for me.
I know you think niggas well, ain't no test to me.
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe- for that,
Some nigga chill on the tech, no speak, blaaat,
Some niggas will put your chest to feet
I'm talking reckless.
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing,
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted.
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted,
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted.
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in.
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is,
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus.
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us,
Looking for model divas that barely speak English,
Fuck 'em while we rich, cause when we broke, they gonna leave us,
We earn stripes, looking like zebras,
Y'all looking like Adidas.
We do it for the streets, cause they need us,
Got beef? Come meet us.
Ok I thought so,
Y'all niggas are so mad cause I floss so bad on bitches,
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso,
Niggas told me good afaso,
Now she yelling out God so much, thought I had her singing gospel.
Shit, shout out to my apostle,
Shit, you know me, nicest nigga in the south,
Yea you can quote me!
Wooo Shit!
Haha
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!
Hahaha
Oohh Shit,
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!
You know!
Fuck boy!﻿[Ring]
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system

Damn, broke is a bad joke but still I laugh though
Frontin' trynna have hope, it's sad though
I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Ay man I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing seen more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like "you a lame-
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga bout' to be though
So give me one year then play this back like T-VO
Cause boy I'm fein'n blow I'm a mothafucking torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquitoes
Uh, I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a god'dam kid, man I'm Pac and BIG
(What up?) "Up" is something that I can't give
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv
Cause even on a slow jam I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some doe man, shit
No dollars got me acting like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and my ex lady
Yea we've been complicating things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish-but naw I can't help it
Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtics-jersey
Regardless of where God lead us,
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina
Uh, but I'm through living in the past Lord
No more thinking rewind and more fast forward
Less rearview mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizing cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my momma a whip nigga he didn't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or loveers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle nigga

Yeah uh!
Uh huh
I'd like to welcome ya'll to

My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
(My life in the sunshine, ok yeah)
Everybody loves the sunshine (This is the come up nigga, uh)
Sunshine (Ayo real quick man)
Everbody loves the sunshine

All the way, all terrain music all day)
There's trees and plants and flowers (It's a beautiful life man)
(Froms rags to riches, watch me man)
There's trees and plants and flowers (From rags to riches)
There's trees and plants and flowers (Uh yeah)
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uh.

[Richie Rich:]
Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

[2Pac:]
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

[2Pac:]
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

[Richie Rich:]
You can ride out with spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

[2Pac:]
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

[Richie Rich (2Pac):]
It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
(You say you don't need a man, but I don't care)
(You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga)

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
(I'd rather be yo' nigga)﻿I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"

"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."

Sing my song, it's all for you [x16]

[Skit 2 Continued:]
"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."﻿In my freshest Js, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gon’ make me late undressin’ me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
‘Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”

Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch (Yeah)
Bitch, I’m the man of the year

What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killin’ off me
Red diamonds he designin’ got me shinin’
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blindin’
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was livin’, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed wit’ my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Bein’ good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gon’ take a minute
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, five years ’til I know thirty
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
Wit’ dessert to take, wit’ dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
‘Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds..)﻿Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Hook:]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

War stories, got tour stories
Pop four whores on the top floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick, that's my ex-bitch, homie, in fact I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slimmin' but her eggs get runny, funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money, from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow up dolls, cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!
﻿[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"﻿[Hook]
Rise above, rise above…
And you’ve got to…
Rise above, rise above…

[Verse 1]
She had her little daughter with her, it was cold out
Said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out
He ain’t answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that’s for safety”
See she been stressin’ lately
‘Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he don’t text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don’t sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he don’t call back, all he say is “fall back”
Nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
She just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he been creepin’, he been fuckin’ with Yolanda
“Yolanda?"
"Yeah girl, Yolanda. Told you he ain’t shit but you ain’t listen, I was tryna” –
[Click] – hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit”
“Pickin’ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights”
“And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”
She gon’ set it off, her daughter gon’ witness it all tonight, damn…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don’t listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
I’m fuckin’ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Lil’ niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they don’t even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
‘Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin’ to call his mother
But she act like she don’t care – what father? He ain’t here
Now she frustrated, thinkin’ that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havin’ to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin’, tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
‘Cause ain’t no hope for the youth, well ain’t that the truth
When all your role models either rappin’ or they hoop, damn…

[Hook]﻿[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[J. Cole:]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
Took my time, crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick I just flow and niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot, bang!

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take
﻿Just got off the phone my nigger smithy
Shit too real back home, bro. real

This for my niggers here, hold your head
I know shit rough but nigger we don't give up
We don't get mad nigger, we just get tough
We just get right nigger, we don't get left
Fuck what they said,
Cause what we learned coming up
You can't teach that shit
Like dealer nigger blows but we eat that shit
This one here's for my brothers we gonna beat that shit
Now, I say my prayers
I got, too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail, or they're dead right now
One time for my nigger crag right now
He in the feds, damn the times change
And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays
You can keep that shit, I just made a million
Call me when reach that shit
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And a young boy from a show down in hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Didn't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep I suppose
But after a year of review
I figured it out it wasn't me
It was you nigger, congratulations﻿Yep
Da dump dump
This is the....warm up

Ok I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up had a hole up in my pocket now its sowed up
They feenin for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it betta load up
I hang my coat up
Ah I'm goin be here for a while so I smile hatas
I'm on that green like a flower like a alligator
Now or laters, I'm serving niggas Imma sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how how I cater, dog what you fraid of, nothing
They talking gangsta, without no data, they frontin
Jackie chan, jean claude van dam straight stuntin, I wish a nigga would say something
Imma carolina nigga boy I got it on my back
Piggyback style I aint talkin bout no tat
And Imma rep the ville in every city that im at
And I guareente I'm bring home plaques
Shout out to my brother zach
And my mother
I love you
Yea, look,
Aint that about a bitch this nigga on his own his dick
They say I'm like the human body I produce my own shit
And I toot my own horn, a star when I was born
My name aint james, my word is bond
Yeah
Shout out to cannibus had a similar line ninety-eight ninety-nine
Damn them was the times
Nevermind dwelling in the past, your listening to the future
Them flows get tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna suduce you like medusa be cool
I said "I got a girl", she told me "me too"
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood (shit)
Baby dont be foolish, but call her I'll watch her do it
You know

And this is only the warm up

﻿[Intro: Mike Epps]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they?
You see them with their wife, like
"What's up Tony? Hey man, how's everything going brother?"
"Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady"
"Alright, God bless you, take it easy now"
You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?"
"Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?"

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, give me my space
Lord ain't enough time to chase all these dreams
I mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl but I told her straight up "don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to living free as a bird, now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down but you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying: "Baby, won't you throw these bands on me?"
And I came to spend, she pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running...

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on

[Verse 2:]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?"
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout
Sleeping back to back, this is wack
We 'bout to go platinum in a minute, crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of the guilt that she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home cooked meals every evening
And even then, your lowest days when you no longer Superman
At least you know you got Lois Lane
But you...

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skate and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me:
"Jermaine, it's all pink on the inside. Fuck what color their face is."
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three fifths of them
And change empower less, brave souls reduce the cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours
Just to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby that's not quite what you excepted
But you refuse to neglect it cause you know your wifey love you
Does you refuse to accept it?
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light skin
Rich white man rule the nation still, only difference is we all slaves now
The chains still concealed in our thoughts
If I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappell?

[Hook:]
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on desperately
Run away, run away, run away, run away
I'm holding on


Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs

[Storm:]
Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, 'til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just cause we bone
Don't mean you own me

You feel me sweetheart?
Let a nigga be free
Don't had a nigga all up on thee
Let him run with his niggas
Let the nigga run the street boo, let him run the streets

[Mutah:]
I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B.
Fetti over something
That's tellin' me don't run the streets

[2Pac:]
So tell me am I wrong ?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs

So you don't believe a nigga
Just cook for a nigga - pleaaaaase!
Make some of that shit you made last meal
Some of them breads and shit
I'll be back through later tonight
I'm hashing weed
We finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize
We finna eat that foods
Smoking ol' blunt
Lay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno and something
Then after that, shit do what after comes to mind baby
Just let a nigga run with the homies
Let me go kick it with my niggas
When I come back, I be all yours
For real

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs

I'll be waiting﻿Yeah
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah.
Fayettenam, what up, man?
We came a long way from sticking move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food,
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape.
All late to class with fake passes,
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing.
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Damon Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes.
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak,
It's all good, probably have a new ex by next week.
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that,
But what I wouldn't give to go back.

[Chorus]

Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,
Yea I sit and wish.
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass,
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh.
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low,
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flow,
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts.
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait,
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it,
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor,
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up.
Momma cut the light on, "Time to get up, "
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out,
At the time I thought this shit was so whack,
But what I wouldn't give to go back.
Yea, hey,

[Chorus]

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,
Yea I sit and wish.
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce,
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss.
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim,
You forgot your school I.d.? Fuck, nigga, you ain't getting in.
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums,
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones.
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say,
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way.
Man we played them girls for the fools, but,
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools,
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn.
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone,
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone,
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks,
Sitting, wishing I could go back.

[Chorus]

Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,
Yea I sit and wish, man.
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man.
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yea, B. Nasty, Big Joe,
Smitty, What's good? Yea,
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith,..
Class of 2003, that's me
I know y'all remember this.
﻿The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip

Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son
Momma’s youngest getting paper like the oldest one
We living better guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty’, but we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we doving them
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em (pincher) like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What’s your name? Where ya from?
Ya got a dream? I’ll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best
And though I’m taking long, they fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top

Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey, don't stop

Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

﻿[Verse 1:]
Gettin higher than the soul of little Shaniya,
To the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire.
I'm burnin tires on the strip, tryna get a grip,
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip.
6 shots of Hennessey, I'm still goin strong.
Please numb me from the bullshit that's goin on.
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered,
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of,
You fuckin coward.
Ain't gotta tell em' go to Hell,
Cause that's the shit that make them other niggas sick in Jail;
So you gon' feel it.
Travel the world reppin this city, know I'm gon kill it,
But yet a nigga ain't got a clue... how I'm gon deal with
All the bullshit. Niggas sendin shots my way.
You put a hit out on me, think that I'm gon stop? No way.
Gon have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin so filthy
Young, Black, and Wealthy, nigga for that I'm guilty.
Still see all the fake shit.
It's funny somehow thought the money could erase it.
No matter how much dough you got you gotta face it,
And to my niggas gone hope you in a better place,
If I make it I'll holla...

[Chorus:]
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can't escape the pain that's trapped in my mind
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget
The industry overlook me for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn't take a chance on me
Suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a cole feature that's gon put you over budget
Picture being broke with no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn the compositions thin
Put it out and hope the World sing
We sippin' liquor for the pain that the World bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that out heroes were some ass holes
Y'all don't hear me, maybe you had the World figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs to waiting on you
Bout a year later the same ones be hatin' on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
We singing songs but we know that ain't true
We know you gotta make the people pay you
Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke motherfucker talkin bout "I stay true"

[Chorus]
﻿She knows, she knows
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch
In his ear sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want
What she want from a nigga
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
Cause I told her I was sleeping
Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die

Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

﻿One time
Reporting live, Compton, California

She go to work, she go to school
Her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible
She's independent, she handle her business
She believe in God and no other religions
Never in competition when it comes to her friends
She's dependable, she set her own trends
A confidant, a mediator
So sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
Look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative
Action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me

That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

Five years later, an accounting major
Work at a firm, abundance of paper
She got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Private bars, executive meetings
Consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress
Probably the only product of a pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building
Real estate, property
She do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
Funded a youth center, invested in some stock
Doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me


We lose touch, separated
Years pass, I'm out dating
She's dating, one of Hollywood's
famous of entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit
She holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star-gazing
Caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee
She looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her... we need we﻿
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome."
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"Cool, where you stay?"
She said: "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" – "No," she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you tryin' to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!
I gotta go to the county buildin, man
These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?
I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)
Kenny! (What?) You on his voicemail! Damn fool (Oh) Shit!
(K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!)
Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn!
(Keep losin' my damn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard and squab, homie)
Just let me— Kendrick
When you get this message, man, call me back
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' about some damn dominoes
It ain’t all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
(Nobody wanna hear yo' ass!
Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe)
﻿I never felt so alive, I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (I don't wanna die no more)
Cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
I'll dry your eyes, I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me
From letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself, well how about that?

She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time﻿Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love
For the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit
On this bus I sit

Thinking bout you

Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special to somebody in a world where they not lovin' me

Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed and the need
To purchase shit from corporations that make a killin'
Because they feed on the wallets of the poor
Who be knockin' on they door, every Black Friday
Just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell, where's your diaper shit here
Lay on your back, don't pee right now or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing that's right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?

People ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
That's the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
She's mine
Catch me
Don't you, catch me
Don't you, catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, cause now your here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin' baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

There is a God
It is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
I've fallen in love
For the first time

[Verse 1:]
She hit that pole in my basement, she rollin', she wasted
She face bout an eighth of that space shit and went ape shit
Don't pace it, don't chase it
That's straight lick - it burn slow
She role play my teacher and I can't wait to learn nigga
I role play big turn up, Obey, that's G shit
We smoking Js of that juicy fruit, that Juicy J, that 3-6
White T's, first class flights and Nike kicks, believe this
Waves on, tsunami, she likely get seasick
I red tail that fly boy, Michael Phelp in the cloud, boy
In the sea of that loud boy, altitude is all altoids
Fresh bitch like breath mints
Whilin up in the section
The monkey's roll and that kush to go
Bottles up in this section

[Hook:]
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down

[Verse 2:]
She dolled up, I'm soda
Red cup that I hold up
Break the milk but wait, hold up
Fuck I do with my roll up
I want this shit and I want you too
I know this shit sound cynical
But can I skip the skit and get into you?
Baby can you strip and get in the pool?
Life is so yummy when your problems taste like honey
Every day so sunny when I'm pound cakin this money
2 hands on full grip, take this shit to the bank
She said boy you takin my breath away
Girl get a oxygen tank
Damn, caught you fallin but my feet were out of bounds
Sooner or later you gon reach some solid ground
Who the fuck said chilvery dead?
Girl, why you quit givin me head?
Makin me call Lewinski
You fuckin up like Hilary did

[Hook:]
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down

Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down
Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down

[Outro:]
I know that I belongs to you
I wonder if I'll ever be found
Caught between the life and the lights and uh
Oh maybe we can figure this out
I figure it's ahead of where the crown I found
The hardest form of troublesome
'Cause we always come undone, yea we always
Yea we alwaysWas a nice middle-class nigga
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport
Plotting on a another way to catch a case
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My finger's on the trigger
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
From the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Straight from the hall to the pen
An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
He carried weight, like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Shorty's gonna be a thug
Little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part!
Got plenty of time (you bad mothafuckas)
You only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby
(Niggas craaazy) Watch the signs!
Damn, nigga! Sixteen, nigga?
Sixteen?! Too bad, mothafuckers

﻿I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now, couldn't be more herer
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Hook:]
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2:]
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Hook:]
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E

Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 3:]
I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

On how to get up off the sidelines﻿Straight out The Villle and I made it,
Like a villian I'm hated
I see'em gillin, I ate it though
Fien'n to blow inflatable, That's undebatable (ugh)
I'm givin niggas food for thought, the flow is cater yo
I'm never faded though,
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the doe related hoe!
It's like my only son, where I go, he come!
niggas dumb to be braggin bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin like the light-skin version of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything!
nigga life a scary game but I'm playin
You sucka nigga lie in everything that ya sayin
Shame on ya'll, you tryna ball with the game on pause
Ay nigga pull the thing on ya'll, ya'll stain ya'll draws
fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on ya'll
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale I excel in this rap shit,
Cause ya'll spittin that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats who made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin for the freaks and the dimes and shine like a mothafuckin diamond,
You shine like a mothafuckin dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate, I grew up with nothin, it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huckstable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzel for
Look how the buzzer grow,
Ballin til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin funny, fuck a joke I'm gettin money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splenda
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba!
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splenda
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba!

[Verse 1:]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -

[Verse 2:]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

[Skit]

[I'm Dying of Thirst]

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
[2Pac:]
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, trick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous

Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

[2Pac:]
How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous

Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin well
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous

Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous﻿[Hook x2: Jhene Aiko (J. Cole)]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we,
And we fly too)

[Verse 1:]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada, Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave
Know you as tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this on
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
The happiness can't buy yo ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride and die chick fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Verse 2:]
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I'm perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that,
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you

Babygirl I love your style I won't even think twice
I ain't even gone front, man a nigga tryna beat

You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear, or
Should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right – catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But… where I’mma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as Hell
And yet I’d love to –
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stay…

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes 'round
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother’s here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the lil’ niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay…

[Hook]

We gon make it baby, no discussions
Bas is nasty, spit disgusting
Gunna and 500 know a nigga hustling?
Got a 20? Fuck it, cop the buds and eat some Ruffles
Far as mook? We gon need a duffle
Do it by the book. Nigga we don't need a duffle
No police, no more trouble
But I'm troubled, got a homie who ain't heed the warning till they slugged em
Now we miss em and we love em
Yea we love em
Lord, I just wanna see his face!
I browse the profile page of my homie slain
I saw a post from a lady and this is what it say
" I cried when you passed away I still cry today
Although I loved you dearly, I couldn't make you the stay"
Live the Land of the Free, but we missin the brave
They tell me " Remember me when you hittin the stage"
In the darkness of night, I'm just missin the days
That's why I spit on this mic, like I was kissin the grave
Yea Boi I

[Chorus x2:]
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes

I used to know this girl she was the Devil in disguise
One look in her eyes
You would turn to gelatin
She only fuck with rappers if you ain't one you irrelevant
Only fucks with athletes if you ain't one then she take off like a track meet
Yea exactly
When I rap she know exactly what I'm sayin (I'm sayin)
And when a nigga ball she know exactly what I'm playin now (iso)
If we go to eat, she look at me till I'm payin now (I know)
Hold up now
You're a groupie. Say it loud, say it proud!
Bitch you lazy or you just a fool?
Shout out to Misha, had her baby and still finished school
I'm a believer
One day I'm a sit on a stool
On top the world and remember I used to sit on a stoop
Never swerve in the coupe
When it's work in the coupe
Now I pirate the game, tryin to earn me some loot
I tell em " Stop being Nazi you better serve me my soup "
But this ain't Seinfeld
I flip that like some clientele
Yea Muuufucka

[Chorus x2:]
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes﻿Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Ay from the door I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford (No I, I, I)
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I.. cry
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile

If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood﻿[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table, my nigga, get you a table, my nigga...

[Interlude]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, OK lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor, swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

[Interlude]

[Ab-Soul]
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soul!) Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Schoolboy Q]
So it's that groovy little nigga known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick, bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws, Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged-out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh, have that pussy throbbin'
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that, twisted off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose; can I get a shot, swim in your juice?
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet - bitch, did you see your tab reciept?

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

“Sherane?”
(Pool full of liqour then you dive in, in, in, in [reversed])
“Sherane, Sherane, Sherane” (Wa-Watch em all f-flock)
"Awww man"
“Sherane” (Girls wanna play, play, play)
Where is she taking me? (P-Pool full of liquor imma d-d-i-iive in)
Where is she, taking… me

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up; never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, moooore
...Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more [3X]


﻿[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command﻿[Verse 1]
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What's the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin' high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin' by
2000's I was concentratin' more on gettin' fly
Gettin' bitches, gettin' rich to get the shit I couldn't buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they'd better warn y'all
I'm here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
'Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don't know
Why the fuck they can't cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I'm knockin' down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood shit – and yeah, I'm 'hood rich
That's good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I'ma tell you straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy on my soul – what I've done and what I've seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things – money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won't be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss in, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin' sons up for less, I don't care how y'all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I'll never know how sittin' comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin' on to old dreams of bein' Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people say they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin' I could levitate, I'll take it straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it
Straight up
﻿Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I (deliver)
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped
﻿Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
To this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bish

Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I’m with the homies

(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
“Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!”)

It’s 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I’ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic ‘cause I’ve never been violent, until I’m with the homies

(Just ridin’, just ridin’)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin’, really trippin’)
Me and the homies
(Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’...)

Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still “nigga, what is you saying”
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'?" “Kicking it”
I should’ve told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi.
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park,
cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he’s not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active


﻿They say anythings possible,
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can hoe
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don't you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man
I'm on these rich niggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Silly head to approach, whats up young blood
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me
Than I surely woulda died
You can throw the fork in me
This my New Years resolution, dawg
No more Pork in me
Uh, I aint no Muslim though
Kuran butler I'm a wizard if he doesnt know
Its young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe
Boy thats just how tough I go
See this is my life work
This shit you callin classic, I be like that mic work
Want you to feel something new, thats how a dike work
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst

Not tonight nigga
Not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Hey, man, hey

Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me
I hit her til she snooze, like the news nigga nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
No she bitter with this nigga
Cause he aint quite me
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure
I am not the husband thoguh
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interupt something real, damn
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions
We both know thats what you wanted girl
I know you listening

Hey
Girl I know you listening
Uh I know you listening
Hey, yeah

Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online trying to find my shit
And to theniggas listening but wont buy my shit
And catch me in the street wanna ride my dick
Y'all niggas is the worst, see me like
"J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD"
Nigga please, an album ten dollars
You act like it's ten g's
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel ya pain, thats why I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and a whole lot more shit
Than got richer and still rapping like I'm poor shit
You niggas thinnk you know shit, nigga you don't know shit
Hoe bitch!!!
Yeah, Cole Bitch!!!
J Cole nigga
Hey
﻿Yea, keep following me keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea
Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky!
Science can tell us how how but they can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed, the beauty of life-
The pain never lasts
The rain always past, the sun don't always shine
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, 100 yrs ago I would of called Id a call this nigga masta
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
I'm looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You cay I'm easily distracted I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm trynna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
Omen
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail, maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart?
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard-
Nights with no progress
Man I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Locness in the projects before I find this-
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Couture strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me
﻿Everything black, I don't want black
I want everything black, I ain't need black
Some white some black, I ain't mean black
I want everything black
[x2]

Six in the mornin', fire in the street
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie you made me
Black don't crack my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook:]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook:]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!



﻿Money coming soon, nigga...
I'm on the come up, chill nigga, don't run up,
A yellow nigga finna rise and shine like the sun up, (yea)
My mind on that paper, I ain't tryna wife a slut up,
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't tryna wipe a crumb up,
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up, (uh)
Don't shed a tear, for a nigga might get done up,
But just say a prayer for a nigga might confront us,
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up,
You coming to the ville, you gotta get a license from us,
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up,
No pain, no gain, my nigga, I just numb up.
I blow brains, go bang a nigga if he jump up,
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up,
This is cocaine on flames, baking soda and water,
And if you feel that, then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy.
Shitting on niggas, like a nigga was still a baby, (uh)
Carolina nigga, shout out to the ville, it raised me,
So many hoes whipped, you woulda thought we still in slavery.
And niggas still sleeping, they feeling lazy, (uh)
A killa? maybe, you make me, I will (uh)
Cheat me on my scrilla, I'll send you to meet Dilla, (uh)
From them NC streets where beef they deliver,
And the clip is on 'E' cause your chest got a filla.
A nigga like me just getting head like a pillow,
Bred like guerillas getting bread,
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed,
Fuck what a niggas said, (man) I'm Fayettenam bombing,
Cause hatred is flattery, you bitch niggas is charming.
Who the fuck you harming? Boy y'all niggas is Charmin, (uh)
And I'm on it, waiting for a target.
You fucking with the best, like Common.
Ah shit, pardon a nigga for departin',
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden.
A nigga finna blow, while you niggas is false alarmin.' (uh)
And just think though, I was raised on Ramen, (uh)
Chicken noodle soup, now I'm filet mignon.'
I promise my momma I was coming to make this money,
And I swear I'm a kill the nigga that try to take it from me.

So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place the value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

This little nigga no older than 17 in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walking down the mean merc where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smurk, he smiled back
He remember this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialled back
How niggas do? he kept it moving, couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, her favourie child
He’s fading out
﻿Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I’m wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault, then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that yola, ask (Keisha) she'll confess
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on (No Make Up) (uh)
Medicated, please my nigga no telling where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at the W, she got double D's bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm trying to dive in the (Swimming Pool)
Left stroke, right stroke, whats the best stroke, that stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro, Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga

[Chorus]


﻿Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

[Hook - Bilal:]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

[Hook]

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

[Hook]

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

﻿Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yea,
Yea
Yeah
Carolina, nigga
Fayettenam, nigga
Yea

This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas,
Them politics, them geek niggas,
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real.
Or them sheet niggas ain't proud of shit niggas, and still,
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel.
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the ville.
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill.
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill.

Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb.
So bitches wanna meet cause I'm deep with my words,
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv,
But peep game.
Before they start saying "He changed,"
A real nigga can never forget where he came.
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game,
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train,
I throw it up!
Yea

If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up,
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up,
Yeah, Chi town throw it up (yea)

As you niggas smoking more kush,
South niggas wreaking niggas, ask George Bush,
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a 'lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like "This feels different,"
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am,
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them.
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end,
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man.
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam,
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit.
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit.
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks.
I throw it up!
Yea

If you a down south nigga, throw it up,
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a Bull city nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a H-town nigga, throw it up, (yea)
You represent that Bay nigga, throw it up, (yea)
And if you from that BK nigga, throw it up (yea)

Greedy niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is,
Hoe niggas love the attention, wanna be famous,
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous,
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it.
And them ladies gonna like cause you light-skinned,
I take advantage of the situation,
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania.
They catch feelings and I switch next,
"I made it clear baby, just sex,
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed!"
Even them white girls tryna be my princess,
But I only fuck with sisters like incest.
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth,
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press,
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me,
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit.
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that shit.
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch,
You better hit up homocide, I just killed that shit, boy!

Throw it up nigga!
Throw Throw it, Throw it up!
Yeah!Aight, new drink
One part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug passion, baby

This drink is Guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, knowhatimean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

[Kastro:]
Mayne! I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier, I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents
they got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather, than stand forever
Been thinkin' drinkin' over a felony
And hell of me
And how it will be in hella shit, people tellin' me to cool out
But they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about
My fuckin' cheddar cheese
and it pleases, passion of mine
Thuggin', huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watchin' just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with the rain twinklin'
Diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me, 'til I'm, old and wrinklin'
and These adversaries
They gonna have to be worryin'
Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion

[Jewell:]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
from the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!

[Napoleon:]
Now what if me
Turn this Hennessy into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly switch and how it supposed to be
And Dirty money
Can't be evil cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
with a Thug Passion

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Puttin' down mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm askin', what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to
That's what money and fame do, see they ain't true
Travelin' this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it, can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion, left me to fuckin' greatest
Load up and take shit

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

[Storm:]
Creep with me, through that immortal flow
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowin'
and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

[Jewell:]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal, meanwhile
Buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
"How does it feel?" what I'm askin'
While I'm rubbin' on that ass "Why you laughin'?"
see, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
baby I'm born to ball
thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion

[Jewell (DJ Quik):]
I heard it's the bomb

I got to warm up man!
Yea, Elite what up! Yea Warm Up
Yea, look niggas wanna know the formula for success, sheeitt, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest boy please
Me I'm trynna stretch my treasurer chest like some double D breast
So a nigga on a quest no question, so I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed I hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign when it's crime and the gats flyin up in Gotham
Watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop them
Watch em better leave em alone like Stockton when he retired
Shit your shit is fire boy stop
I don't buy, boy caught, stop laying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
That's cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blue with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep﻿
Yeah,
Hey,
Yeah,

Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huckstable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they packed like lunchables
Like white boys in grade school
While we ate school made food just
Eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn't buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man
That's just life that's just how shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt
Even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back
Who's officially stupid
Oh yeah I understand that's your man,
You had a plan
You been together for some years
You sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears but we both know that's a bad look
Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce
Cole, cole, cole

If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce
It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A Ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said that's for busters that heard my shit and I made it cool
This ain't to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in that missions office
And possibly cause all the hoe niggas scrape
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I'd much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout
I used her ass for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
Till I got free from my momma leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame
No not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin' niggas, eventually R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some
That just how it's happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
Cause see some niggas was haters that I viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down

[2Pac:]
A military mind, nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

[2Pac:]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac:]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
And feared men grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin' on ‘yak
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin' 'til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'

[2Pac & Kastro:]
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas despise, look in my eyes

[Kastro:]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryna tell you

[Edi Amin:]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin' greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game something D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open - the ridin' and smokin'
Collidin' with foes - in the worst place;
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin' game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[2Pac & C-Bo:]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[C-Bo:]
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up hoes and keep mobbin' G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

[2Pac (Napolean):]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise (look in my eyes)
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise (look in my eyes)

[Napoleon:]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happened then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got whats mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal when got some war stories for you

[Storm:]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies in my mind, can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin' war stories

[2Pac:]
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes


[2Pac:]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal N Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is


﻿Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

[Chorus]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
cause I'm a trip

Landing on another runway, fly with me
or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta be that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

[Chorus]

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
on some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing
[Verse 1 - Bas:]
I thank God for the blizzard, we snowed in
Girl you lookin' like you rode in on a piff cloud
Was it frozen? and where the piff now? are you holdin'?
Cause I damn sure is lil' mama, newsflash, this shit potent
Lil' mama leave ya baggage at the door, please check yo shit
Cause that's yo biz, lil' mama me and you
Well we here for another reason
It's December but I'm feelin' like another season
Cause the flowers in June gon' sing a love tune
And a howl at the moon, tell her bring ya love soon
Sharper than a harpoon, yeah, shorty wetter than a monsoon
Yeah, I read your colors like a cartoon
But this purple say we depart soon, gone

[Hook:]
Can we take a little trip?
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower

[Verse 2 - Bas:]
You take me high like a seaside tidal wave
Final days we spend 'em confined inside a cave
With a moat of Hennessy, marijuana blaze
Liquor flowin' in the sleet, whole 'lotta haze
Whole 'lotta chicks wanna take ya place though
You the only one I could never replace though
They might replicate yo style
Can't replicate yo smile, you on hold
Ain't no doubt, could you wait here for a while?
Could you be the one that's always gon' look out for me?
See them birds on my arm and know it's falconry
Cause you elevate me higher than a balcony
But when you high, girl you always start to doubtin' me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bas:]
We super mooked, high, I look in ya eyes

Kind woman, divine woman
But if you disrespect [?] Genghis Khan woman

Life is so cruel you had better times honey but
It's always stormy 'fore the beautiful day
And, sometimes you corny in the cutest of ways
And, a bit annoying cause you blew all my haze, but it's cool
Now you horny cause you blew all my haze
Got me in a daze girl, yeah, cause ya strength make me brave girl
Take a gaze, I know it's dark, but me and you?

Here you go, wearin' that
Already know, what I'm staring at

(Oooh, oooh﻿I place blame on you still
Place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for?
Nigga, I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you're fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

[5x:]
Loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you too

House keeping
[Knocks]
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡
!Disculpe!

And you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTime'd the one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTime'd instead of a hospital visit
'Cause you thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed."
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speaking, nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk [gulp] I cry myself to sleep
Bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you [gulp] I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say, "You gotta go."
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

﻿[Intro]
Yeah
Fresh off the motherfucking broadcast
And I’m here, fuego nigga
Yeah, hey, uh, it’s happening fast
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
I told niggas on the low, but they ain’t hear it though
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow
We eating better than we was a few years ago
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it’s May day
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn’t fade us
Bitch I made straight A’s, go ‘head, try and degrade us, haters
But this one’s funny: man one year later I was on them phones
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody’s got a story dog
Unfortunately learned I can’t do nothing for you dog
I’m trying to run the whole game like a morning jog
With hits like a porno blog
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour
Ain’t judging though, to each his own
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home
More power to you, but a message to you fuck niggas
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain’t mine
That’s cold blooded but ain’t nothing new
Same old, fuck it though, what’s up with you?
If you made it this far listening without skipping
Then I gotta show love, don’t worry I’m just venting
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it’s truly accurate
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!
Nobody touching me, it’s like I got the cooties rapping
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right
I find myself fiendin’ for a spot to go at night
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life
The unabomber, bitch I’m blowing up over night (BOOM!)

[Outro]
Hey, yo, it’s happening fast
I say it’s happening fast
All the drama that I had to get past
Will it last? Or will it pass?
Just as quick as it came
Hoes knowing my name
Dog, welcome to fame
I pray to God we don’t change
But even if you don’t
Most niggas look at you strange
But I guess I can’t complain (Hey)
Hey man it’s happening fast
I say it’s happening fast
I say it’s happening fast
﻿I was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, seven days later
after I wrote him "stay strong, keep your faith in God"
what I told him, hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
Doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
Your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks
Ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine, yeah

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
after he just got out, fifteen years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or whatnot
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced
Then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips
Found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life, I can only imagine
That's fucked up, I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence
with no parole, the state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy
That's what I call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick
The government help? No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all
But ninety-percent unfair, care? Nah
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand, more prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business, imagine
We being used, imagine, the truth shall be told﻿Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside, when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home
Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh!
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming, back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe"
You're a vanity slave
We all vanity slaves
and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
You know them checks come in
I'm tryna get something, but what up? ﻿How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

Trials and tribulations
I'm facing in this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

My dad, he died, he got shot cause his friend set him up.
And I didn't go to his funeral..and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me.
And she..and she say, clean up..I say..

Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

I get mad, I slam my door and go in my room..
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"
﻿Yeah

Hey,
To the college kids no scholarships, starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya
Life is your professor, you know that bitch is gon test ya
I got some shit I'd like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic
He said Cole, "a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic"
Nobody touching Nas nigga it's more like Villematic
Uh, these fayettnam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theatre gon tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?
I guess it's in God's hand's
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn
That's for your non-believers, I'm the truth only time will teach ya
And fuck the haters probably never love they momma's neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class
Homes with computers on hating on the newest song
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans
Tryna to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fucking song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!
Pardon the stereotype
But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman
One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitttin' and the nigga Cole spittin' that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before
And RnB bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it's own
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for chesse on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, than go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit
You want change, this that "between the seats in your couch" shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire my nigga they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah
It's finna be a long year, yeah

I know you feel that,
The tingle in your spine don't conceal that
Don't conceal that
This exactly what you thought
Somebody bought the real back
Hey

Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade)

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I brag like Hov', sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots and I don't mean no disrespect
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot? huh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is, pause
Maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hangin' out
My pop's was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say "fuck"
If the hoes like it, I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying "Fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie"
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it, it was "Fuck him again"
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know, in a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me, I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Verse 2:]
I'm prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm on the really, what could you actually tell me?
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese "Sorry"
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas "sorry"?
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education, would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris (Vroom)
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in him, I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again

Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody

Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3:]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma lade
Beyonce told me that she want to cop the new Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward (awkward),
Want to know what else is really awkward (awkward)?
When niggas buy rings for bitches that have flings
When I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars

Re-adjusted my target audience, cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way
Like Timberlake produced by Timberland
On that goddamn Futuresex Lovesounds
What's playing in my mind? Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer, now what have we here?
Now I got to mask my tears, but I

Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like HovI will replenish your missing faith
Coming live from 65th with cake
Sippin' got me pissin' and getting baked
Got my fifth and 8th of weed
Did you pitch in cake?
So no five, homie get away
Still money over hoes til this fuckin' day
Cause diamonds are forever, but that pussy ain't
And knowing that I know she probably still gon' be on me
Cause she know Cozz be after the bill like Cosby
Some niggas choose to be salty out of all of the seasonings
First off I'll never understand what the reason is
Second off you're opinion ain't achieving shit
Third, I'm probably the best
Bitch I can go back and forth, I'ma plead the 5th
But fuck you and your policies, I'd rather keep it gutter and honestly
The world won't give a fuck about us obviously
Not your neighbor, not your friend and not police
But it don't bother me
I'm tryna reach my goals with the rest of my soccer team
You know we mob deep
Yeah you lookin' at the prodigy
Ruthless I gotta be, no more apologies
Yeah you might catch me by the beach
But I can still tell you all you need
About them pimps roll in them 6-4's
Home of the 6-0's, it get's cold
Nigga just get low, my ammo
Cause niggas pull a pistol quick for

Watch out, better duck, test your own luck
But a nigga might die thinking that they give a fuck
Throw your set up, naw dawg, we don't even bang
It's a Mittee Gang thing, nigga we just tryna hang
Throw your set up, dawg it don't matter where you from
It don't matter where your block at, it don't matter what you claim
Throw your set up, you can go and still test your luck
But a nigga might die thinking that they give a fuck

It's nothin personal
Just talking my shit, ain't tryna diss you
So don't try to hit me with some shit that you ain't in to
Bitch you must have some serious issues
Tryna get my last initial and some money out of him too
That's like tryna stash the paper from a pencil
When it comes to the tissue, ain't getting shit out of this dude
I call it being smarter but some people call it karma
They deserve the curb but I ain't concerned, just wearing my armor
Cause you never know, the one's that close be the one's that harm you
So constantly my eyes on watch
But that's probably because how life was taught to those who live in the hood and know to fight you stops, never
Yeah we clever but we still need more lessons on Tetris cause we still won't unite the blocks
Might not lose your life to the pipe and rock
But might if you pipe a thot or fight the cops

So watch out, better duck, test your own luck
But a nigga might die thinking that they give a fuck
Throw your set up, naw dawg, we don't even bang
It's a Mittee Gang thing, nigga we just tryna hang
Throw your set up, dawg it don't matter where you from
It don't matter where your block at, it don't matter what you claim
Throw your set up, you can go and still test your luck
But a nigga might die thinking that they give a fuck
Throw your set up
﻿It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, y'know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
until I finally realised that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'ma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focussed
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
and admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I re-up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Kendrick Lamar]
What up Dasan? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a (Black) one
with Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh﻿I feel like we should just you know keep the world in suspense no longer 
And you know just put J. Cole on the spot
Yea, anyway can turn me up?
Yea, yea, yea
Hey, yea, there's no way to turn me up?
If not it's all good
Yea, hey hey hey
I bet they never seen him coming, like a blind bitch you fucking from behind
It's the mother fucking dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like the prom
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks
Flip, flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Hlaf black other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op
You know you is not", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip hop gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot,
Even if you squatted under volcanoes niggas your shit not
I'm raw but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends
Praise God but I give not to the Reveren's
Looking up to the heavens like,
"Where did all my blessings go?"
You chasing dreams but then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch heres an episode
Professional, set to blow any minute now
Many women smile, look the lights and the action
And the cameras be calling
You niggas got to log in, bitch you fantasy balling
I snuck up like I planned to be
This ain't randomly recorded
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that twitter shit
Thought I get a deal then head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal
I probably can't afford benifitis
Medical, dental shit
Left but I always came back like a rent a whip
Dirty ass game, dog I can run a kennel with
All these bitch niggas who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on them
Start talking that beef shit, I turn the Kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yea! And I'll still keep going, keep flowing
﻿Yea, hey
Yea, hey, Fayettenam
Yea, bitch

Yea - I'm sippin liquor for the pain
Pourin liquor for the slain
Nothin else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
And my mind tryna figure where these twenty g's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Countin' days still waitin' on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small,
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small
I could give a damn girl, and fuck that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep seein just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard, lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty kat to make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love wit dat
At the door, wit a towel on, and nothin under that sayin

Welcome
(hey-yeah)
Welcome
(yeah-yeah)

I let these words flow out, like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, it's the pain from the crowd
Cause these words go deep, from my soul when I speak
Then my flows hit the souls of all those that I reach
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone? And if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts sometimes I wonder if I'm sane
Man it's hard to trust friends, when the paranoia blends with the marijuana,
Wonder will this high ever end
Swear I'd never smoke again, ya'll niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot man this liquors all I need
Just to put me in a zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me got me feelin so alone
They wonder whats on my mind, whats lingerin in my dome
I tell them ain't nothing wrong I'll deal wit it on my own
I'll deal wit it on my own

Welcome
Yea - I'll deal wit it on my own nigga
Welcome﻿
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Hook:]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

[Pre-Hook x2:]
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

[Hook]

[Dr. Dre:]
Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[George Clinton (Kendrick Lamar):]
Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Pre-Hook]

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
It's the females that be hanging
It's the females who be hanging

All of this for a necklace? All of this for a Lexus?
All of that for attention, you been through a lot I'm guessin'
A lot of drama at school, coulda sworn it was more electives
His parents did a lot of yellin'
Coulda sworn it was more effective
Over here you better have brains or be a Western Ave. slave
Getting beat by your master when you can't behave
Only thing they got in common, they tryna get paid
See money is a thang, cause I know with money I could make that prom pussy purr quick
But I ain't worth shit, she don't look to a God
It's a man that she worships
Cause the man keep her afloat, as if they were ships
But you gotta think about the bigger picture
I know that nigga hit ya
You don't deserve that type of shit
You a queen, you a God, you a perfect type chick
I got this weed, I'll roll it up
I know you'd like a hit, I know you'd like a hit
You be stressin' like a motherfucker

[Enimal:]
I know you been stressin' baby, nothin' but a Western slave
Chasin' that paper baby, nothin' but a Western slave
I know you feel the pressure baby, but don't let it get you baby
Nothin' but a Western slave, we nothin' but Western slaves

[Cozz:]
I swear I can't die alone, man I can't die alone
Promise to hold my hand while he's at my head with the chrome
I swear I ain't done no wrong, but shit we all done some wrong
But does that mean I should go? Shit, too late baby, I'm gone
It happens just like that, you could go in an instant
Momma always told me to make better decisions and I still ain't learned my lesson
I'm probably kicked out the house with no place to crash at, in need of an intersection
Better yet it's best I start from scratch, so I sleep with the dogs to get flea infested
Been itchin' and sniff a kitten in order to sneeze, just to get a blessin'
We all be stressin', that ain't no question
No judgin', just progression
Live and learn lessons, burn herb essence
Fuck the bullshit, we laugh tryna have a good time
Before we all die, baby we all go through hard times

[Enimal:]
I know you been stressin' baby, nothin' but a Western slave
Chasin' that paper baby, nothin' but a Western slave
I know you feel the pressure baby, but don't let it get you baby
Nothin' but a Western slave, we nothin' but Western slaves

[Cozz:]
Yo, Cozz & Effect nigga
Yeah, you fall, you get up
You fly, you stay high, yeah
You do what make you happy
﻿Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep, and
Wet dreaming, thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Hook:]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said, "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked
When you laying on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talking shit, knowing damn well I was a virgin, fuck

[Hook:]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying, "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos, trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth
Yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, cause..."

[Hook:]
Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos; that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on; still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't want to talk to me, just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number?
Are you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme
Take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
[2Pac:]
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

[2Pac:]
[*laughing*]
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

[Hussein Fatal:]
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
'Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

[Kastro:]
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

[Napoleon:]
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

[2Pac:]
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride

[Mussolini:]
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, ridin' Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Inglewoods banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

[E.D.I.:]
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'mma commence
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin', Thuggin'
To my fuckin' last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

[Kadafi:]
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a shorty I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth

[Mo Khomeini:]
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin'

[2Pac:]
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride

[2Pac:]
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby

Makaveli, Hussein, Kastro, Kadafi, Mussolini
Amin, Napoleon, Khomein
What y'all really wanna do?
Haha, like them niggas said
"What would you do? If you could fuck with me and my crew"
Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, yeah nigga

We die nigga, but we multiply, we like legends nigga, like forever
Like I'll make you famous motherfucker
I'm talkin about Newsweek and Time Magazine and all that ol good shit
My niggas make the papers baby
My niggas make the front page
The gunshots can't stop me, they know [*fades*]
﻿Who dat who dat, the nigga you been waitin 4.
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago.
Rappers is bull shittin. Fuck it,
I ain't hatin though
Cuz Now a nigga hot enough to
fuck with one of satin's hoes.
& She cant tell the difference.
I been through hell conditions.
Wishin for air conditions
feelin God was never listenin.
Now I'm on television
And did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary,
boy you failed the mission.
Speakin of positions? Just witness
how I elevated. Real niggas celebrate it, finger-fuck
whoever hate it. My life accelerated,
but had to wait my turn. But then I redecorated,
that means my tables turn. Live life, might as well,
only way to learn. Is try and fail clientele
the only way to earn. So if you're sellin crack..
or if you're sellin rap. Make sure it's mean
so them fiends keep on trailin back.

[Chorus]
Who dat who dat bitch I got the flame [x3]
So don't worry bout no muthafuckin name

The Mind state of a winner.
When you thinkin bout summertime
i'm thinkin bout the winter.
When you thinkin bout breakfast,
I'm heatin up my dinner. I was plottin this
moment back when yall was ridin spinners.
Now I'm a menace. God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup.
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet.
Cloud told me "ain't you roc? well? where the fuck yo chain at?"
Guess it's somethin like your girl, nigga it aint came yet.
The man make the chain chain dont make the man
how many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame
the cloth from which we came me and them is not the same

Yeah
Oh, nah, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Yeah

Uh, Wassup
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money you can never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance
Girl I already tried with a lot of these niggas
Fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient's when I make a world premier
Aw, Damn, Word
Award shows coming?
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make the shit into a song
You ain't living that boy, stop stealing that light
Anything can happen when I do see y'all, guess it all depends how I'm feeling that night
Okay
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ahh
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love em all, I just love me more

[Yukimi Nagano (Little Dragon):]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rush in the night like a shock, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to -
Set the alarm cause those thrills that run up my back
You're my star nothing else can lead me off track


Hey-yeaahh....
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising hot
Your innocence -
Who's the brave?
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You'll expire
By the throat

Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives 'cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me 'cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

You leave your kids with your mama
'Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
'Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
'Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, 'cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? 'Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch—I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
﻿[Verse 1:]
Yea, like I said man, you niggas need to be out there and smoking something man
You know what I'm saying?
Yea, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop to the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are, usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina where I made it from
Cold world no blanket son
Girls fast how Jamaican run
Puffin on the city where the Lakers from, L-A, L-A, la la
So high everything is a ha ha from me
Dreamin of the days of a Drop 500 and a bad bitch that will go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry, if you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mom wanting out, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not... hope not... hope nothope not
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
I'm just trynna make it my nigga

[Verse 2:]
Yea yea
A wise nigga told me don't chase that cash
Follow your heart you'll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass or does she wise to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face just gassed like, baby girl why you take this path?
Stack in his hand trynna make that last, all she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub tities in his face and laugh, gotta try not to look fake in fact
Alittle more money like a few more 20s and you let that nigga grab your naked ass?
Okay hes gone now
Roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear,
This ain't the life for you baby let me take you out of here cause.
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
She like, Nigga yea right, do you know how much mutha fucking money I'm making?

[Verse 3:]
Yea my nigga sit back blow in the air
Only getting high cause we close to the hell
Nigga trynna like like Hova oh-well, we broke and that doe coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard til there no inhale
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now the hold him in cells
My mom broke but she posted the bail
Someway, some how niggas feelin like the sun down even when the sun up!
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But, this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trynna raise her sun up
Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor could'ntgive one fuck
While she sangin
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
Damn, told you niggas cold world no blanket
Tough Luck, yea﻿
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

[Bridge:]
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

[Hook x2:]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]

What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:

[Hook]



﻿[J. Cole - Chorus]
Hey, one time
Hey, one time
One time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I'm right
And girl you damn right, if your head right
I'll be there every night
I just might change your life
'cause baby...

You got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it)

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Hey Cole World, real cold world
I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl
Last time I seen you, you was a little old girl
I had a crush now we grown and we still so thorough
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted
I swear nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
God damn your ex man is a dumb ass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressin' you, wasn't fucking you right
Well one man's trash is another man's treasure
One man's pain is another man's pleasure
One damn thing you can't change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together
It's whatever, you shine, I shine,
I know you got a 9-5 I'll be your 5-9!

[J. Cole - Chorus]

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror
I'm picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I'm peaking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't beg I'll be thinking bout your ass
For the whole week no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine I don't speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I'm tryna be lowkey
She tell me I go that flame, your rhymes are so deep
Man, girl thank you, shit you so bad know your daddy wish he could still spank you
Hold up for these other niggas roll up and try and get you
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with you
I'm tryna vibe with you so wont you throw me your phone number
And let them lames get you old number

[J. Cole - Chorus]

[Wale]
Roc Nation, Wale
Look, Cole World, still a cold world
And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough
Whole town, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there's still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a black panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads flip my pole
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I'm something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding
And theres something you ain't seeing like I block your vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred k in 22 hours
See money talks, you motherfuckers is Boomhower
No check back, in debt yep
Loud in my J, I smoking Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be
Flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it's late right now, I need a beat
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of slow death
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed
I don't need no chains with no cross to know that I'm blessed
On the road again, no hoes, just friends
Fuck nah, we on chainsaws
Cause all we want is them pesos
The reason why y'all probably all stay broke
I'm an inch away from that payroll
A foot away from that
About a yard away from that
About a mile away from that
Tired of sayin' that, I'm the man
I'm killin' these niggas, got one hundred rounds
I don't be fuckin' around, I'm fuckin' around with' a chick that's 200 pounds
And it's all in her ass, hips and them damn tits
Causin' your mistress mattress, causin' magic with' his johnson
So you know, it's 24 hour fitness, when I'm in it I give you 'bout fifteen minutes
If I'm in it and this is some chick that I ain't really feelin'
So can I talk my shit again, even if don't hit again
Dog, who you kiddin', claimin' you do not be sippin'
In order to get it we all gotta kiss some ass
In order to get it, it's part of the mission, excuse me
